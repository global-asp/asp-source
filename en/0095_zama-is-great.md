# Zama is great!

##
My little brother sleeps
very late.
I wake early, because I
am great!

##
I am the one who lets in
the sun.

##
"You're my morning
star," says Ma.

##
I wash myself, I don't
need any help.

##
I can cope with cold
water and blue smelly
soap.

##
Ma reminds, "Don't
forget teeth."
I reply, "Never, not
me!"

##
After washing, I greet
Grandpa and Auntie,
and wish them a good
day.

##
Then I dress myself,
"I'm big now Ma," I say.

##
I can close my buttons
and buckle my shoes.

##
And I make sure little
brother knows all the
school news.

##
In class I do my best in
every way.

##
I do all these good
things every day.
But the thing I like
most, is to play and
play!
