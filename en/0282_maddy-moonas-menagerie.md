# Maddy Moona's Menagerie

##
My name is Maddy Moona,
And today I'm turning five.
Dad promised I could choose a
pet,
A real one! Something live!
We'll travel across the whole
wide world,
Searching Mali through Tibet,
Until we find the perfect one...
Oh, I know just what I'll get!

##
I'm going to get an elephant.
I'll ride on it to school.
My brother Billy can walk
behind
he'll think I'm awfully cool.

But... what if Ellie caught a
cold?
I guess she'd sneeze.... A LOT!
There is no tissue big enough
to wipe up all that snot.

##

##
I want a Nile crocodile sent to me by the pharaohs.
I'll call him Tut and feed him soup, fish fingers, and baby marrows.
I'll keep him in the bathtub and brush his pearly whites,
But... what if flossing all those teeth takes me all day and night?

##
Perhaps a pair of porcupines,
for games of robbers and cops.
Their prickly quills will be handy
for holding up sweetie shops.
I can munch away on candy
bars
while my gang sharpen their
spines.
But... what if my sharp-shooting
pals
put me in the firing line?

##
Maybe I need a stealthier plan.
Let's clear out the store with
funk!
There isn't a smellier critter on
earth
That's what I want — a skunk!
But.... what if I can't go into the
shop
after Skunky has let off his
stink?
Sweets are no good for my
teeth anyway.
A rotten idea! I need to rethink!

##
A rhino! The horns, the big
stomping feet,
the armour on both of its flanks!
Billy would never chase me
again.
It would be my own personal
tank.
But... what if Billy raises his
temper
and Rhino goes on the
rampage?
Crash bang boom! The teacups!
The plates!
Now I'm grounded 'til I'm gran's
age.

##
I need a beast to tame my
brother.
With teeth, sharp claws and a
roar.
A LION! I could feed it Billy
Biltong...
Yes! A lion would settle the
score.
But... a lion has a huge
appetite.
Skinny Billy won't satisfy.
And once Brutus has a taste for
us Moonas,
he'll see me as Maddy stir-fry.

##
Dad thinks I should choose a
cuddlier pet.
My parents are so hard to
please.
They want me to have a pet I
can hug.
A python? A python has
squeeze.
But... if Snakey develops too
much of a crush,
he'll suffocate me with
affection.
To be honest, I just can't marry
a snake!
And reptiles can't handle
rejection.

##
No, reptiles aren't the way to
go.
I definitely need something
taller.
A giraffe would be awesome. I'll
slide down her neck,
and think up a long name to call
her.
But... something more than
eight foot tall is
no good.
Our house has a rather low
ceiling.
I'd spend hours massaging
cricks out her neck.
My fingers would lose all their
feeling.

##
None of these are the perfect
pet!
Oh what, oh what will I get?

##
Those animals just don't work.
None are my perfect partner in
crime.
I want something with fur, a pet
who will follow.
Oh wait! I know — a canine!

##
My Bandit is the biggest bark on
the block!
He's the fastest pup in the
west!
Nothing can stop us. Not Billy
nor bedtime.
I love my Bandit. He's my best!
