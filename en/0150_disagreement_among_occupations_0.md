# Disagreement among occupations

##
In a village there was a
disagreement among people
of different occupations.
Everyone thought their work
was the most important!

##
The teacher said that he had
the most important occupation.
“Without teachers you could
not go to school and learn.”

##
The builder said that he had
the most important occupation.
“Without builders you would
not have schools to learn in
or houses to sleep in.”

##
The carpenter said that he had
the most important occupation.
“Without carpenters you would
have no furniture for your
houses and schools.”

##
The doctor claimed that he had
the most important occupation.
“Without doctors and nurses
you could get sick and die.”

##
The farmer said that she had
the most important occupation.
“Without farmers you would
you would not have food
to eat."

##
The student argued that
students had the most
important work.
“Without students, there
would be no teachers,
builders, doctors, farmers,
or carpenters.”

##
Eventually everyone agreed
that all the occupations are
important.
We need teachers, builders,
doctors, farmers, and
carpenters.
But everyone has to be a
student first!
