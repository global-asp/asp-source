# Sindiwe and the Fireflies

##
One day a very clever baby was
born in Gungululu in the
Eastern Cape.
Her name was Sindiwe Magona.
She was the oldest of eight
children.

##
At night, her grandmother told
magical stories about ogres and
giants, animals of the forests,
great beasts, and little
creatures of the veld.
It was Sindiwe's favourite time.

##
Sindiwe loved school and she
dreamed about being a teacher.

##
When Sindiwe became a
teenager, her family organised
a feast to celebrate.
She was given special things to
wear and a wise old man sang a
praise song to her.
(Blessings, long life! May your
ancestors guard you!)

##
Sindiwe trained to be a teacher.
She was very excited to teach
at her first school.
But there weren't enough
schools for black children and
they had no desks or books to
write in.
This made Sindiwe feel scared.
How could she be a good
teacher when the children had
nowhere to sit?

##
She left the school to work as a
cleaner.
She worked in four different
houses. Sometimes the people
there treated her badly and
Sindiwe became very unhappy.

##
All this time Sindiwe studied.
Her hard work paid off!
She won a scholarship to study
at a university in New York.
She and her three small
children packed their bags and
flew across the sea to the
United States of America.

##
In New York, Sindiwe studied to
become a social worker. She
wanted to help families make
their lives better.

##
When she finished studying, the
United Nations gave Sindiwe a
job.
Most of the countries in the
world meet at the United
Nations to talk about their
problems.

##
Sindiwe told the world about
South Africa, and how hard it
was for black people living
there.
The people at the United
Nations loved to listen to
Sindiwe's stories. They wanted
to learn more and more about
South Africans.
Perhaps, together, they could
help to change things in South
Africa.

##
She worked at the United
Nations for twenty years while
her children grew into adults.
But Sindiwe missed the country
where she was born.
She wanted to tell her stories to
the people at home.
So she packed her luggage, got
on a plane and flew back over
the sea to Cape Town.

##
Sindiwe's love for books and
stories have helped her write
piles and piles of books.
And children and grown-ups
love to read her stories.
Many people call her Nomabali
because she's always writing,
telling and reading stories.
