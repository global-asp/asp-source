# Swimming in the Zambezi

##
It was a bright sunny Sunday afternoon. The young girls in Lusese were gathering under the branches of the biggest Musikili tree in Caprivi.

##
The excited buzz of their voices was heard all over the village. They called their friends. "Nakamwu, I'm waiting for you." "Hurry up, Chaze." "Silume! Come on!"

##
Maria looked around for Ntwala. Ntwala took them swimming every Sunday. "Ntwala! Ntwalee! Ntwalaaa! Ntwaloo!" she called.

##
Ntwala shouted from the other side of the village, "I'm here! I'm waiting for you." All the girls ran to find her.

##
"Are you ready to go swimming today?" Ntwala asked them. "Yes," they shouted happily as they hopped and jumped with excitement.

##
As they walked to the river Ntwala told them stories. "Tell us about when our village was flooded," they called. "Tell us about the Jackal and the Baboon."

##
Beside the river there was an enormous marula tree. The girls looked for the biggest marula fruit for Ntwala.

##
"I've got the biggest," shouted Joy. She gave her marula fruit to Ntwala.

##
"Off you go and swim," said Ntwala to the girls. They all ran into the water, shrieking and giggling as they felt the cold water of the Zambezi River.

##
Ntwala stood on the bank. She watched for crocodiles. She watched the older girls racing and diving. She watched the younger girls splashing and learning to swim.

##
"Competition time," she shouted at last. "Stand in a line." She picked up the biggest marula fruit. She threw it as far as she could into the water.

##
"One, two, three. GO!" she called. The children ran into the water and swam to the marula fruit. Ntwala watched them.

##
"I'm first!" shouted Maria and Chaze at the same time. "You are both first," called Ntwala.

##
"I want to race again," said Maria. "OK!" said Chaze. "Can we, Ntwala?" asked the other girls.

##
"Stand in line again," Ntwala told them. She picked up a marula fruit and threw it as far as she could.

##
"One, two, three. GO!" she called. The children ran into the water and swam to the marula fruit. Ntwala watched them.

##
"I'm first!" shouted Chaze. Maria stopped swimming. "Chaze is the winner," said Ntwala. "Well done, Chaze. Let's go home now."

##
The children walked home with Ntwala. "Tell us a story, Ntwala," they asked. They loved to listen to her stories.

##
Maria crept up behind Chaze and pushed her to the ground. Chaze started to cry. "Chaze's mother will beat you," said Joy to Maria.

##
"Maria! Why did you hit Chaze?" asked Ntwala. "She won at swimming. It's not fair," Maria said.

##
Ntwala asked all the girls to sit in a circle. "What did the principal tell us?" she asked. "It's bad to fight. People who fight must be punished," said Nakamwu.

##
"Maria must say sorry," said Namasiku. "Chaze must hit her back," said Joy. "No, it is wrong to hit each other," said Ntwala.

##
Ntwala said, "I think Maria should miss swimming next Sunday." Maria cried a flood of tears. "I... I... I'm sorry Chaze. I'm sorry I hit you. I'll never hit anyone again," she apologised.

##
"I forgive you," said Chaze and put her arm around Maria. "Maria and I will come home with you," said Ntwala to Chaze. "Maria will apologise to your mother too."

##
Maria told Chaze's mother, "I hit Chaze because she won the race. I'm sorry. Chaze is my friend, it was bad to hit her."

##
Mrs. Sibungo listened to Maria. "That was wrong Maria, it is bad to hit people. Thank you for apologising to me. I forgive you." Mrs. Sibungo told Ntwala, "You are a good leader."

##
Mrs. Sibungo spoke to all the children. "Ntwala thought of a good punishment for Maria. She hit Chaze because she lost the swimming race. Now she will not be able to race."

##
"But Mum," Chaze smiled, "I don't want Maria to stay at home next Sunday. I want to race her at the swimming next week too!"
