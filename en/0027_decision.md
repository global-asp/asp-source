# Decision

##
My village had many problems.

We made a long line to fetch water from one tap.

##
We waited for food donated by others.

##
We locked our houses early because of thieves.

##
Many children dropped out of school.

##
Young girls worked as maids in other villages.

##
Young boys roamed around the village while others worked on people's farms.

##
When the wind blew, waste paper hung on trees and fences.

##
People were cut by broken glass that was thrown carelessly.

##
Then one day, the tap dried up and our containers were empty.

##
My father walked from house to house asking people to attend a village meeting.

##
People gathered under a big tree and listened.

##
My father stood up and said, “We need to work together to solve our problems.”

##
Eight-year-old Juma, sitting on a tree trunk shouted, “I can help with cleaning up.”

##
One woman said, “The women can join me to grow food.”

##
Another man stood up and said, “The men will dig a well.”

##
We all shouted with one voice, “We must change our lives.”

From that day we worked together to solve our problems.
