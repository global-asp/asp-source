# Silkworm

##
The worms laid small
eggs on the leaves.

##
We fed them mulberry
leaves.

##
They grew bigger and
became fatter.

##
The larvae made silk
cocoons.

##
Inside the cocoons, the
worms turned into
pupae.

##
Some people breed
silkworms for a certain
purpose.

##
In China they keep
thousands of kinds of
silkworms.

##
They make silk cloths
using their cocoons.
