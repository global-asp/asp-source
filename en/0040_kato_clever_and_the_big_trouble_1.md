# Kato Clever and the big trouble

##
In a small garden in the city, there
was a big tree. Many small animals
lived together on the big tree.
There also lived a family of
squirrels.
Vikki was one little squirrel among
them who liked to talk big. His
cousin, Kato from Far Forest had
come to visit him.

##
One evening, as all the animals who
lived in the little garden were just
going to sleep, they heard loud
sounds from the park, next to the
little garden.

##
Kato and the other squirrels saw big
yellow machines, and men in hard
yellow hats, pointing to the little
garden and other houses on the
street.
They were going to pull them all
down and build a parking lot.

##
The people who lived there would
move to other houses. No one gave
a thought to the animals, birds and
insects who lived in the little
garden.

##
The machines were first spotted by
the mole family. To be more exact,
by Mister Popples, the eldest who
told Master Mopples, who in turn
told the youngest, Little Popples.

##
When they were young they were
called Pop, Mop and Pip.

##
Mister Popples told the squirrels, the squirrels told the birds,
caterpillars, butterflies, tiny spiders and all those who lived in the
little garden.
There was total panic, a lot of running, flying, scurrying and
hopping, with no one knowing what to do? Where to go?
The caterpillars said, "Let us look for leaves." The butterflies said,
"We want flowers." The mice wanted holes. The squirrels, birds,
insects wanted trees, bushes and grass.
All the animals wanted the soft earth, not cement or concrete.
"Where will we find all this?" they cried. "We will surely die," they
said and wept.

##
Kato's uncle and aunt were very quiet and all the
little squirrels crept close to their mom.
Kato cleared his throat and spoke shyly, "I live in the
Far Forest, may be we can all go there?"
There was a buzz of excitement and someone said,
"How?"
Kato scratched his head and thought hard, "Well, the
Squirrel Express can take the squirrels and the
butterflies, spiders caterpillars and all the insects.
The birds can either fly or come with us. The moles,
mice and the grass snake family can go by the
underground Mole Express."

##
Everyone thought it was a splendid idea.
Mister Popples rushed to ask Mister Grumbles, the
driver of the underground express train if he could
take them all to the Far Forest. Mister Grumbles
fumbled, stumbled, bumbled before he finally
mumbled, "Alright."
Now it was Mister Popples' turn to be grand. "Friends,
you need not wory, my grandfather's
grandson's...third nephew's second niece's family
live in the Far Forest.

##
So, in the early hours of the
morning the Squirrel Express and
the Mole underground train with all
its passengers, chugged their way
to the Far Forest with its trees,
flowers, ponds and soft earth.
