# Dima and Owl

##
In the old days there were two
people, Dima and Owl.
Owl owned the sun, water and fire.
Dima did not have any of these
things and lived in darkness with his
family.

##
Dima tried to make a garden, but
he could not grow vegetables
because there was no sun.
Everybody suffered because there
was no sun.
When they hunted animals to eat,
they hung the meat in the trees to
dry, but it rotted because there was
no sun.

##
One day, Dima decided to visit Owl.
When they served food, Dima
wondered why Owl's food tasted so
good. He wondered if it was
because the food grew in the sun
and it was cooked in fire.
Secretly, Dima made a plan. He
decided to dance. He wanted
everyone at Owl's place to gather
around him and see him dance. He
was a good dancer. Owl and his
family admired the beautiful
dancing.

##
When it grew dark, Owl decided to
fetch the sun from his house so that
he could still watch Dima's dancing.
Owl kept the sun in an animal skin
bag inside his hut. He carried the
sun out from his house and held it
high up above his shoulders.
Now it was light. Everyone could
see far into the distance. Soon
everyone was dancing in the light of
the sun.

##
Dima crept closer to the sun while
he was dancing. Owl held on to the
sun but after a while he forgot
about it because he enjoyed the
dancing so much. He saw how
beautifully Dima danced. He too
wanted to dance like this.

##
Suddenly, Dima took his fighting
stick and hit the sun into the air
like a ball. The sun travelled so far
that it remained forever in the sky.
It gave everyone light all day.

##
Dima ran away so fast that Owl
could not find him.
He stayed far away for a long time.
After a while, he disguised himself
and went back to Owl's place.
The children recognised him and
said:
“There is the man who stole our
sun!”
The adults did not agree with the
children and said,
“No, this is not the man who stole
our sun.”

##
They saw that this man was an old
dancer. He wore a lot of beads
around his body. They were magic
dancing beads and they made
people dance.
It was not long before everyone was
dancing. They danced the whole
afternoon, until the sun began to
set. It became too dark to see the
magic dancer.

##
Owl said to his wife, “Go and look in
my bag and fetch the moon.”
Owl held the moon high above his
shoulders and it lit up the darkness
for all to see the dance. While they
were dancing, Dima moved closer
and closer to the moon, for he had
a plan.

##
He took his fighting stick and hit the
moon high up into the air. Once
again, he ran away from Owl. This
time he stayed away for a very long
time, until Owl's family forgot all
about him.

##
Dima disguised himself again and
returned to Owl's place.
This time he wanted Owl's fire. Owl
had the firesticks hanging around
his neck.
Dima joined Owl under a tree and
the two men started playing an old
clapping game called gi.

##
They clapped and clapped and as
they clapped some more, Owl's
firesticks started jumping around
his chest to the rhythm of the
clapping. Clap-clap, clap-clap.
Dima tried to grab the firesticks, but
Owl threw them over his neck so
that they hung across his back.

They clapped the whole day long. The rhythm of the clapping
made Owl forget all about the firesticks.
When they swung around onto his chest once more, Dima grabbed
the firesticks and ran away.
Owl and his family ran after Dima, but he made a clever plan. He
had a bag full of thorns and threw them onto the ground behind
him. This stopped Owl and his family from chasing him. They could
not cross the thorns on the path.

##
Dima could not wait to make fire.
He rubbed and rubbed the sticks.
He blew and blew the ember in a
little dry grass until a tiny flame
appeared. The fire grew and lit the
whole veld and each time the
flames reached a tree, Dima said,
“From now on people will be able to
make a fire with each tree on
earth.”

##
A long time passed. When Dima
finally returned to Owl's place, he
found no one but a little boy playing
with wooden animals.
Dima asked the boy to show him
where they kept their water. The
boy led him to the place of water.
Dima saw the big djaba, the huge
clay pot in which the family stored
water.

Dima pretended to leave for his home, but he secretly turned
round to the place of water. He turned the huge pot over so that
the water started flowing on the ground.
Dima quickly jumped over the flowing water to the other side.
Then he was safely across the river of water where Owl could not
find him.

##
This is why the whole earth has
rivers full of water today.
This is why we have the sun, moon
and fire, because of the magician
Dima.

Story notes
In 2003, Katunga Carimbwe told this version of the Dima and Owl
origin story to Titu Mangumbu and Marlene Winberg in the
Northern Cape Province of South Africa while he was busy painting
on a canvas. Mangumbu, Mahongo and Winberg translated it and
retold the story in this written version with as few alterations as
possible. His elders told the story to him during his childhood in
Mavinga, Angola, where he was born in 1958.
Most of the episodes in the Dima and Owl myth have a wide
distribution in the extensive area of southern Africa and the
Kalahari whose original inhabitants speak !Xun and other closely
related languages, although the names and identities of the
trickster, Dima, and his adversary change from area to area.
The “clapping game” mentioned in our version, Dima and Owl, is
still current among the !xun, the Nharo, and possibly other
communities of Kalahari San. This story depicts Dima as a culture
hero and transformer of the primeval world into the present world.
He achieves this with words, “From now on people will be able to
make a fire with each tree on earth.”
The Manyeka Arts Trust holds a !Xun audio telling of this story by
Meneputo Mnaunga Maneka in archive.
