# Anansi and Vulture

##
Anansi the Spider and Rabbit were
friends. They lived in a peaceful
village in the mountains.
Rabbit owned a big farm with lots of
vegetables and fruit.
Even though Rabbit shared
generously with his friend, Anansi
was unhappy and jealous.

##
So Anansi thought of a clever plan
to take over Rabbit's farm.
Soon Rabbit was left poor and
homeless. Anansi was the proud
owner of all Rabbit's land,
vegetables, and fruit.

##
Anansi went to the market to sell
his fruit and vegetables.
He made so much money that he
filled a big basket with it!
With some of the money, he bought
maize for his family, and put it on
top of the money in the basket.

##
Anansi happily headed home with
his basket on his head, singing.
He was thinking about all the things
he was going to buy with his money.

##
On the way it started to drizzle.
Soon the drizzle turned into a heavy
downpour.
Anansi the Spider left his basket on
the side of the road to shelter under
a tree. But from there he kept a
close watch on his precious basket.

##
It started to rain even more heavily,
and Anansi was getting cold and
wet. So he ran into a hole.
“I will stay in this hole until the rain
stops,” said Anansi to himself. “At
least my money is protected by the
maize I put on top of it.”

##
A little while later, Vulture was
flying around and spotted the
basket on the side of the road.
He saw that there was money and
maize in the basket.
So he covered the basket with his
wings and waited for the rain to
stop.

##
Anansi saw Vulture sitting on his
basket.
“Oh thank you, my friend, for
protecting my basket,” he said to
the Vulture.
“Excuse me, Anansi, did I hear you
right?” asked Vulture. “Your basket?
This basket is mine! I found it here
on the road side!”
Anansi could not believe his ears!
“It's mine, I tell you!”

##
Furious, Anansi went and reported
the theft to the chief. But Vulture
said to the chief and his elders,
“How could anyone leave a basket
full of money and maize unguarded
on the road?”
“But I was watching my basket,”
said Anansi. “It's my money and my
maize!”
“I was looking after the basket
when you came and said it was
yours!” replied Vulture.

##
When the chief and his elders had
listened carefully to both sides, they
sent Anansi and Vulture away.
They discussed the story for a long
time.
Eventually they reached a decision.

##
They summoned Anansi and the
Vulture again.
“We believe Vulture's story,” they
said. “He is not the thief. You were
trying to claim something that was
not yours.”
Anansi could not believe his ears!
He burst into tears.

##
The news soon spread that the
judgement had gone against
Anansi.
As he walked away, he heard Rabbit
laughing and laughing.
Rabbit went back to his farm and
grew fruit and vegetables.
But Anansi was poor again, with no
friends.
