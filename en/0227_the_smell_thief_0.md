# The Smell Thief

##
Mr Shabangu was the best baker in
town. Every morning he woke up at
four o'clock to mix and knead the
dough for his famous buns, cakes
and biscuits.

##
By eight o'clock the people of the
town were walking past the bakery
on their way to work and school. By
this time the cakes and buns were
almost cooked, and the most
delicious smells wafted out of the
bakery's windows.

##
Many of the people went into the
bakery to buy their breakfast. Mr
Shabangu smiled happily at them
as he passed them the fresh, tasty
cinnamon buns and warm, golden
biscuits that were so famous in the
town.

##
But other people were not so lucky.
Because they had so little money,
the poorer people of the town could
hardly ever afford to buy any of the
delicious buns, cakes and biscuits.
All they could do was enjoy the
lovely smells that drifted out of the
bakery windows.
When Mr Shabangu noticed these
people sniffing the air near his
bakery, he said angrily, ‘How dare
they sniff my delicious smells!'

##
‘Those are MY smells. I made them, so they belong to me! If people want to smell my
wonderful smells, they should pay for them!' He huffed and puffed and wiped the sweat
from his brow, before turning back the oven to bake some bread and rolls for his lunchtime
customers.

##
One old woman especially loved the
smells that drifted out of the bakery
window every morning. This was Ma
Shange who slept on a bench in the
park every night.

##
A few weeks before, a kind person
had given her the money to buy
herself a cinnamon bun. She had
taken the bun back to the park and
ate it very slowly, licking her lips
and sharing the last crumbs with
the birds.

##
After that, although the old woman
didn't have enough money to buy
breakfast, she longed for the
delicious bun again. So every
morning she walked slowly past Mr
Shabangu's bakery, sniffing the air
and smiling blissfully at the mouthwatering smell.

##
Ma Shange's new habit made the
baker very angry. As each day went
by, he grew angrier and angrier
with her.
Finally, one winter morning when he
was in an especially bad mood, he
stormed out of his bakery and
grabbed the old woman by the arm.
‘How dare you steal my smells!' he
shouted. ‘You're nothing but a smell
thief!' He wiped his hands on an
apron, then pulled it off and threw it
back into the bakery.

##
‘This is the last day this cheeky
woman will steal my smells!' he
shouted. And with these words, he
dragged Ma Shange off to the court
to see judge Ngwenya.
The judge was sitting down at his
huge, shiny desk when the angry
baker stormed in, dragging the
quivering and confused Ma Shange
with him.

##
‘Good morning,' said the judge in his deep voice.
‘Sir,' said Mr Shabangu furiously, ‘I demand justice! I wish to lay a complaint against this
woman. Every day for the last three weeks, she has walked past my bakery early in the
morning when my delicious smells are at their best, and stolen them. I demand that she
pays for those smells!'

##
And with these words, he dragged
Ma Shange off to the court to see
judge Ngwenya.
The judge was sitting down at his
huge, shiny desk when the angry
baker stormed in, dragging the
quivering and confused Ma Shange
with him.

##
‘Good morning,' said the judge in
his deep voice.
‘Sir,' said Mr Shabangu furiously, ‘I
demand justice! I wish to lay a
complaint against this woman.
Every day for the last three weeks,
she has walked past my bakery
early in the morning when my
delicious smells are at their best,
and stolen them.

##
The judge scratched his big, bald head for a moment. Then he cleared his throat. ‘Fair
enough,' he said to the baker. ‘Justice will be done.' He turned to Ma Shange. ‘How much
money do you have on you, Madam?' he asked.

##
‘Only two rands,' stammered Ma Shange.
‘Well,' said the judge, hand it to me, please.' Meekly,
Ma Shange reached into the pocket of her tatty old
cardigan and pulled out two one rand coins. She
handed them to the judge. He took them, thanking
her politely.

##
Then he shook the coins in his big fist, so that they
made a clinking sound. ‘This is my judgement,' he
said to the baker. ‘The punishment must fit the
crime. Therefore the sound of Ma Shange's money is
the payment you will get for the smells she stole.
And now I wish you a good day.'
The baker looked thoughtful. Then, realising how
unreasonable he had been, he turned slowly and
walked out of the room.

##
The judge smiled kindly at Ma Shange, and handed
her back her money.
'Now, Madam, he said pulling a brown paper bag
from his briefcase, would you care to join me for
breakfast? These buns are still warm, I bought them
only half an hour ago.'
