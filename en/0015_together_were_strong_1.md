# Together We're Strong

##
One harsh winter, many people in the land were sick. Ma
Monikazi's cheeks burned. Sweat dripped from her body. She
wanted to hold the icy grass to her face to cool down. Under her
blanket she held her belly and sang to the baby inside her: “Be
strong, little one. Winter's not long. Be brave, little one. Together
we're strong!”
Her stomach growled when the baby's powerful kicks woke her at
night. She ate the leftover meat in the cooking pot, hungry for life.

##
One bright night the moon was
bigger, fatter and pinker than ever.
Her breath came fast. The baby was
ready. The aunties in the birthing
room rubbed her back and warmed
the water. When Monikazi held her
beautiful daughter in her arms, she
knew she was a special girl, a
fighter.
What a blessing! Her name is
Nontsikelelo. She will be the mother
of all blessings.

##
Nontsikelelo was beautiful and
strong with crinkling black button
eyes. She loved her older brother,
Mcengi. He made her laugh and so
the laughter spread. She loved to
eat meat before she had teeth. Her
favourite aunt always kept a little
portion on the side of her plate for
Ntsiki. Mcengi chased the chickens
that scratched in the garden where
Ma Monikazi grew spinach and
squash to feed her family. Ntsiki ran
after him as her legs grew strong.

##
Ma Monikazi had another baby boy, Velaphi, and another,
Qudalele. Finally another sister, Nomyaleko. Little Ntsiki folded
napkins and washed the baby clothes. She swept the house and
fed the fire. She picked up her baby brother when he cried and
tickled him till he laughed.
She taught them to sing: “Be strong, little one. Winter is gone. Be
brave, little one. Together we're strong!”

##
Qingqiwe, her grandfather, raised
horses. His favourite was Shishi, a
glossy black mare. As soon as Ntsiki
was old enough, he hoisted her on
to the saddle in front of him. His
strong arms reached around her. He
laced the reins through her fingers.
He taught her to talk softly to
Shishi, to groom her with a hard
bristled brush. When she stroked its
glossy coat, Albertina whispered,
“You are the most beautiful
creature. Thank you for letting me
ride on your back.”

##
Her father, Bonilizwe, came home from the mines at Christmas.
Ntsiki pulled herself up onto Shishi's broad back. She rode out to
meet him at the bus stop. Ntsiki sat tall and straight. Her
knees held firm. She handled the reins with gentle fingers.
How proud Bonilizwe was of his daughter. The biggest smile Ntsiki
had ever seen covered her father's face.

##
On her sixth birthday she went to
school. “You must choose an English
name,” said the Presbyterian
teacher, but Ntsiki liked her own
name. “Why do I need a new
name?” she asked. The teacher
scowled and read the names aloud:
“Adah, Agnes, Albertina, Anna.”
What did they mean? Ntsiki liked
the long name best.
Al-ber-ti-na! The name had rhythm.
Al-ber-ti-na! The name had bounce.
Albertina was a name you didn't
mess with.

##
When her cousin married a handsome man from a nearby town,
Albertina was chosen as an umkhapi. The maid of honour! Weeks
before the wedding, she stitched her isikhakha, the short
traditional skirt, and threaded bright beads onto her amatikiti. Her
mother gave her the white flag and said, “You have a big job, my
blessing.”
At the bend in the road Albertina waved the flag, then turned
Shishi back, leading everybody from miles around to the
ceremony. People would gossip if she made a mistake, but the
guests lined the road. They ululated and sang. They threw down
flowers for the horse and the girl.

##
Her mother was often sick and
needed Albertina to look after the
home. In her last year of primary
school, Albertina was the oldest
pupil in the school. She was chosen
to be the head girl and wore her
badge with pride.
Her best friend, Betty, told her
about a competition, saying, “You
must apply, my clever friend.”
“What is the prize?” asked
Albertina, growing curious.

##
“A scholarship to high school!” said Betty. “You must apply. You'll
win it, for sure.”
Albertina studied until the candle burned down. She practised
sums. She practised spelling. She sharpened her pencils and gave
her shoes an extra shine. Next morning she passed Shishi in her
paddock. The horse whinnied and stamped the ground.

##
The test began. Albertina's fingers
shook. The sums were tricky. Her
mouth went dry. Her hand cramped
on her pencil but she continued.
“Well done, Albertina!” said her
teacher at the end. The important
official arrived and called the top
two students to the stage. “Well
done to Albertina for full marks,” he
said, “but you are too old. The
scholarship goes to…”

##
Albertina tried not to cry. “That's unfair,” shouted Betty, hopping
with fury. “That wasn't in the rules!” How would Albertina go to
high school now? She dragged her feet all the way home.
The teacher wrote to the newspaper about the unfair decision.
Brother Joe at the Catholic Mission station read the story over his
breakfast. He cracked his boiled egg with an extra flourish. He
pushed the newspaper across the table to Father Bernard. He
didn't like the story one bit either.

##
Soon enough there was a
scholarship for Albertina. Mariazell
near Matatiele was a long way from
Xolobe, but the whole village
erupted. Their home girl was off to
high school. She would make them
proud. They threw a party like no
other. The women brewed the
sorghum beer and lit the fires. They
slaughtered chickens and stirred up
pots of meat. Albertina smiled till
her face ached.

##
She packed her brown suitcase and polished her shoes again.
Before setting off on the bus to
Matatiele, she said goodbye to Shishi. Albertina brushed her coat
and stroked her wiry mane. She whispered all her questions into
the horse's silky ear: What if I get lost? Will I make new friends?
Will I still be clever so far from home? Shishi whinnied and
stamped the ground.

##
School days started well before sunrise. The girls washed quickly
in the cold water and swept the dormitories before Mass. The milky
porridge was never quite enough; the stew not as tasty as Aunty's
back home. But Albertina studied hard. She played netball on
sunny afternoons.
In her school holidays Albertina worked at the mission station. She
rubbed and scrubbed against the zinc washboard. She boiled
sheets in copper tubs, then wound them through the wringer. She
hoed and tilled the school garden but missed her family. Who was
telling her brothers and sisters funny stories? Who wiped their
eyes when they cried? Who tickled them until they laughed?

##
Albertina loved the nuns who taught
her. Could she become a holy
sister?
“But nuns earn no salary,” said
Father Bernard. “Perhaps you
should become a nurse? You'll be
paid while you study.”

##
Albertina took a train to
Johannesburg. She bought a smart
white uniform, new navy shoes and
a shiny red fountain pen. Sick
people came all day to the hospital.
She cleaned their wounds with
careful fingers. She held the old
people gently. When the babies
cried, she sang: “Be strong, little
one. Winter's not long. Be brave,
little one. Together we're strong!

##
Some nights Albertina worked till dawn. She looked out the window
and thought of her family. Were the children hungry? Did they go
to school? Who was riding Shishi? She remembered the dark green
spinach. She missed the scent of the earth. There was no
vegetable garden here. There was nowhere for a horse.
Albertina never went to parties. She saved every shilling. On her
days off she learned to play tennis. Whoosh! Plop! She whacked
the ball across the net. Always, she wished for a little more money
to send home.

##
Walter Sisulu was a brave and
clever man who dreamed of
freedom for South Africa. His big
smile captured Albertina's eye.
They walked together down the city
streets. Her delicate hand rested on
his arm. Walter wanted Albertina to
be the mother of his children.

##
Bright ribbons decorated the Bantu Men's Social Centre on their
wedding day. Albertina's long-sleeved dress had a swirling train of
lace. Many friends blessed their special day. Albertina planted
flowers in her little garden. Within a year, Max was born. Albertina
had become a mother. One day people would call her the mother
of the nation.
Max had his mother's black button eyes and his father's round
chin. He was the hope for their future. Albertina wanted to fight for
a new South Africa, so that Max could be free. When he cried, she
sang: “Be strong, little one. Winter's not long. Be brave, little one.
Together we're strong!”

##
Police came in the middle of the
night, banging on the door.
Albertina scolded the men who
messed up her house. “How rude
you are!” she said, “trampling mud
inside my home.”

##
In the morning Albertina's favourite flowers lay crushed beneath
their footprints. She remembered chasing the chickens from her
vegetable garden back in Xolobe and set about replanting her
garden. The earth, she knew, would recover.
She would support her husband who kept many secrets and hid
from the police.

##
She joined the women and worked to organise a march to Pretoria.
The women refused to carry a pass. They sang, “Wathint' abafazi;
wathint' imbokodo! You strike a woman; you strike a rock!”
Many hard years followed after Walter's arrest. He was jailed on
Robben Island for 26 years. Albertina, also, was sent to jail many
times. Often she was scared. Often she was lonely.

##
But even on the darkest nights, she
could see a sliver of moon through
the window in her cell. She sang the
song that Ma Monikazi sang before
she was born: “Be strong, little one.
Winter's not long. Be brave, little
one. Together we're strong!”
