# Khalai talks to plants

##
This is Khalai.
She is seven years old.
Her name means ‘the
good one' in her
language, Lubukusu.

##
Khalai wakes up and
talks to the orange tree.
“Please orange tree,
grow big and give us
lots of ripe oranges."

##
Khalai walks to school.
On the way she talks to
the grass. “Please
grass, grow greener
and don't dry up."

##
Khalai passes wild
flowers. “Please
flowers, keep blooming
so I can put you in my
hair."

##
At school, Khalai talks
to the tree in the
middle of the
compound. “Please
tree, put out big
branches so we can
read under your shade."

##
Khalai talks to the
hedge around her school.
“Please grow strong
and stop bad people
from coming in."

##
When Khalai returns
home from school, she
visits the orange tree.
“Are your oranges ripe
yet?” asks Khalai.

##
“The oranges are still
green,” sighs Khalai.
“I will see you tomorrow
orange tree,” says
Khalai. “Perhaps then
you will have a ripe
orange for me!”
