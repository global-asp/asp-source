# Zanele Situ: My Story

##
I was born in summer, in a town
called Matatiele in the Eastern
Cape. Matatiele is near Lesotho
where there are many mountains. In
the winter they are covered with
snow.

##
My father was a builder and he
moved from place to place to find
work. We moved to Lesotho and
that's where I started school. I was
very happy. But when I was eleven
years old, I grew tired and weak,
and then I couldn't walk. My parents
took me to the hospital.

##
I had to stay in hospital for three
years. I was very tired and I slept
many hours every day. After three
years the doctors told me I would
not be able to walk again.
I was very sad because I love
sports.

##
I went to a special school in Umtata,
and my teachers encouraged me. It
was a very busy school, with lots of
activities like sport and sewing. On
weekends we had tasks to do. We
had to clean our rooms, polish our
shoes and clean our wheelchairs.

##
I decided to keep trying, and never
give up. If you have a disability, you
can still do something you love. I
love to see how far I can go, so I
entered a competition. I won a
bronze medal for shot putt, a silver
medal for discus and a gold medal
for javelin.

##
I wanted to get better and better at
my sports, so I trained very hard.

##
When I rested, I loved to sew and
listen to gospel music.

##
I entered more competitions and I
got many medals and prizes. I
started to dream about maybe
competing in the Paralympics one
day.

##
The Paralympics are just like the
Olympics, where the best athletes
in the world compete for gold, silver
and bronze medals.
But in the Paralympics, the athletes
are disabled in different ways, so
they have to try even harder to
train and win!

##
Then I heard that I was going to
Sydney in Australia, to take part in
the 2000 Paralympics. At last we
were in the plane, flying over the
Indian Ocean!

##
But when I got there, I suddenly felt
very scared of all the people
watching me. I just wanted to go
home again.

##
Then, when I threw my javelin it
landed far in front of everyone's. I
broke the world record and I got a
gold medal! I was the first African
woman to win a gold medal in the
Paralympics. I was so happy and
very proud.

##
My motto is: Keep going, follow your
dreams and never give up. Even if
something happens to make you
sad or scared.
That is what I teach my little girl,
Azamazi. She is eight years old and
she also loves to do athletics and
gymnastics.
I am still training and going to
competitions, and in 2016 I hope to
go to the Paralympics in Rio de
Janeiro.
