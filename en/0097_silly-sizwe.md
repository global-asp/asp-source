# Silly Sizwe

##
Once, long ago, there was a boy
called
Sizwe who lived with his mother
near to the Chief's kraal.
Now Sizwe did so many silly
things, that everybody called
him “Silly Sizwe.”

##
The Chief, who lived in that
kraal, had a daughter who
never ever smiled or laughed,
even when someone did
something very funny or tickled
her.

##
One day, Sizwe and his mother
had nothing eat, so his mother
told him to go and get a job at
the Chief's kraal. He was asked
to collect all the eggs, which
the hens had laid all around the
kraal.

##
All day Sizwe looked for eggs, and when it was time to go home, he was given
some eggs to take to his mother. He was very happy as he ran off with the eggs
in his hands. But just as he passed the Chief's house, he tripped over a stone and
dropped the eggs.

The Chief's daughter watched as he tried to catch them
before they fell on the ground. He looked very funny, but
the girl did not even smile.

##
When he got home, he told his
mother what had happened.
“You silly boy,” said his mother.
“You should have put the eggs
in your hat and you could have
brought them safely home.”
“Never mind Mother,” said
Sizwe.
“I will do that next time.”

##
The next day, Sizwe was asked
to milk the
Chief's cows.
When he had finished milking at
the end of the day, he was
given a bucket of milk to take
home to his mother.
Just as he got to the Chief's
house, he remembered that the
bucket belonged to the Chief.
So he poured the milk into his
hat. Then Sizwe put his hat on
again.

##
Woosh! The milk splashed all
over him.
He looked very funny, as the
milk ran down his face and
clothes.
The Chief's daughter saw what
happened, but she never even
smiled.

##
“You silly child,” said his
mother, “If you had carried the
bucket in your hand, you could
have brought the milk safely
home.”
“Never mind Mother,” said
Sizwe. “I will remember to do
that next time.”

##
The next day, Sizwe had to look
after the Chief's pigs. He
worked very hard feeding the
pigs. When the work was done,
he was given a little piglet to
take home.
Remembering what his mother
had said, he tried to carry the
piglet in his hands. But the
piglet wriggled and wriggled,
until it wriggled out of his
hands.
Sizwe tried to catch it, but he
fell in the mud.

##
The Chief's daughter saw Sizwe
fall in the mud, but she did not
laugh. She never even smiled.
His mother was very cross with
Sizwe when he told her what
had happened.
“You stupid boy,” she said, “you
should have held the rope and
pulled the piglet behind you.”
“Never mind Mother. I will do
that next time,” said Sizwe.

##
The next day, Sizwe had to work in the Chief's kitchen. He
worked hard all day washing the dishes. When all the work
was done, the cook gave Sizwe a big fish to take home.

Sizwe was very happy with the fish, and remembering what his mother had said,
he tied a rope to the fish and went off home, pulling it behind him.

##
The chief's cats smelled the fish
and came running out of the
houses to get a bit of fish. Soon
they had eaten all the fish.
By the time he got to the
Chief's house, all he was pulling
was the fish bones.
Did the chief's daughter laugh?
No, she did not even smile.

##
“You silly, silly boy,” said his
mother when she told her what
had happened. You should have
carried it on your shoulder.”
“Don't worry,” said Sizwe, “I will
do so next time.”

##
The next day when Sizwe got to
work, he had to clean the cow's
kraal. He worked hard all day. At
the end of the day, he was
given one of the Chief's cows to
take to his mother.
Sizwe was very happy. He
remembered his mother's
words, “Carry it home on your
shoulder.”

##
Sizwe got down on his hands
and knees under the cow. then
he pushed and pushed until at
last he had the cow on his
shoulders.
As he staggered past the
Chief's house, the daughter saw
Sizwe. He looked so funny!
And do you know what
happened?
She laughed and laughed and
laughed.

##
The Chief was so happy to hear
his daughter laugh, that he
called Sizwe into his house and
told him that because he had
made his daughter laugh, Sizwe
and his mother should live in
the kraal.
So Sizwe and his mother went
to live in the Chief's kraal.
Everybody lived happily ever
after.
