# Locusts

##
One day we saw a strange black cloud move in from far away. 

It was a swarm of locusts, headed for our village.

##
The locusts attacked farms and ate the crops.  

##
We tried to chase the locusts away. 

But they would not go. 

##
We made noises and screamed, “Wuwi, wuwi!” 

But the locusts would not go.  

##
We hit tins and metal pots. 

But the locusts would not go.

##
We lit fires to chase the locusts away. 

But they would not go.

##
They settled on trees. 

Branches broke because of the weight of all the locusts.

##
Then we remembered that roasted locusts are good to eat!

Everyone started to collect the locusts in sacks and nets.

##
Children brought gourds and filled them with locusts.

##
We roasted locusts and fried them. 

We even dried locusts for the cold season.

But still, there were so many locusts.

##
Then, the next morning, the locusts flew away. The cloud left our village.

##
When the farmers saw their farms, they moaned loudly: “Our farms are destroyed!” 

The villagers cried, “What will we eat this year? What have the locusts left us?”
