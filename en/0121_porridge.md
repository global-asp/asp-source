# Porridge

##
Zama is getting ready for school.

##
Dad is cooking porridge for breakfast.

##
"Mom makes the best porridge!" says Zama.

##
Porridge gives Zama energy for school.

##
The porridge is ready.

##
Dad pours the milk, with love.

##
"Dad, I think this porridge needs more sugar," says Zama.

##
"Mom's porridge tastes much better than Dad's porridge," thinks Zama.

##
"Dad, please can I have more sugar?" asks Zama.

##
Dad gives Zama more sugar.

##
"Wu! Dad! You put salt on my porridge!"

##
"Dad, when will Mom be home?" asks Zama.
