# Azizi the doll

##
This is Azizi.
Azizi is my doll.

##
I like Azizi because he
always smiles.

##
After I wake up I wash
my face.
Then I look for Azizi.

##
When I find Azizi I brush
his hair.

##
When I eat breakfast I
feed Azizi.

##
When I eat sweets I
give one to Azizi.

##
But Azizi never eats his
sweet.
I wonder why!

##
I walk around the
compound picking
flowers.

##
I give a flower to Azizi.
But he never says,
“Thank you.”

##
I wash Azizi clean
before my mother
bathes me.

##
I dress Azizi in red
because I love the
colour red.

##
When I go to sleep, I lay
Azizi beside me.
