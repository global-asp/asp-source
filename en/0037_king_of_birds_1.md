# King of birds

##
Once long ago, the birds had a
meeting. They wanted a king,
just like people and animals.
Which bird should be king?

##
"The Eagle, he is strong and
kingly!" said one.
"No, he has no crown, and when
he calls, he sounds too sad,"
said another.
"Then Ostrich, because he is
the largest and roars like a
lion," one called out.
"No, he can't fly. The king of the
birds must be able to fly."

##
"I think I should be king," said
Peacock, fanning his tail. "I am
so beautiful."
"You are too proud," said Owl. "I
have the largest eyes of any
bird. I should be king."
"No, not you, Owl," they
shouted. "You go to sleep when
the sun rises."

##
And so they didn't get very far.
Then one bird had an idea. "He
who can fly the highest will be
king," he said.
"Yes, yes," they shouted, and
they all flew up, up, into the sky.

##
The Goose flew for one day,
straight over the highest
mountains in the world.
The Eagle flew for two days into
the blue above the mountains.
But the Vulture soared for three
whole days without stopping,
straight toward the sun.

##
Way above them, the birds
heard Vulture cry, "I am the
highest, I am king!"

##
But then just above him Vulture
heard a tiny voice, "Tink, tink,
tink! I am the highest, I am
king." It was Ncede, the
Neddicky, the smallest bird of
all!
He had held onto the great wing
feathers of Vulture as he soared
into the sky!

##
"You won't beat me again," said
Vulture, and soared straight up
into the air.
He flew up and up until he could
fly no more. "I am higher than
any other bird. I am your king!"
he cried.

##
But out from under his wing
crept the tiny bird.
"Tink, tink! Tink, tink! It is I, the
smallest one! I am your king."
Vulture was too exhausted to fly
any further.

##
So down he sailed - with the
little bird still under his wing.
The other birds were furious
with Ncede.
They waited for him, ready to
pluck out all his feathers

##
But the quick little bird saw how
angry they were, and flew into
an empty snake hole.

##
"With your big eyes, you must
keep guard at the hole and
catch him when he comes out,"
they said to Owl.
So Owl sat in front of the hole.

##
But the sun was warm and soon
Owl was fast asleep.
The little bird peeped out, saw
that Owl was asleep, and z-zip,
away he went.

##
Owl was very ashamed that he
had let the little bird escape.
Now he only hunts at night.
In the day, he sleeps, away
from the sight of the other
birds.
