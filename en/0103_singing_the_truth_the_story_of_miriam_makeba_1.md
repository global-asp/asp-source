# Singing the Truth: The Story of Miriam Makeba

##
A long time ago, in the vast city
of Johannesburg, a baby girl
was born. That baby was me.
My mom called me Miriam.
Miriam Makeba.

##
Mom was a sangoma, but she
also worked to make other
people's homes neat and clean.
It was hard for my mom to earn
enough for both of us. She
started selling homemade beer
to bring in more money.

##
The laws of the land said that
selling homemade beer was
wrong. The police sent my mom
to jail for six long months. I was
only 18 days old, and needed
my mom. So even though I was
just a baby, I went to jail too.

##
As a little girl I loved to sing.
When I was older, I helped my
mom clean houses. Singing
songs as I worked made the
chores go faster and the days
seem brighter. Singing made
me happier than I can explain.

##
I sang in my church, and this
made others happy too. Music
has the power to bring people
together. When we were singing
we felt brave and strong.

##
People said my voice was a gift
and my songs were special. I
sang with other musicians and
our music was heard all over
the world.

##
My home was Sophiatown, a
place of culture and music.
Sophiatown, a place where
South Africans could make
music in harmony and dance
together. But the people who
ruled the land at the time did
not like this togetherness.
Those rulers didn't want black
and white people to be friends.

##
I knew it was wrong to treat
people differently because of
their skin colour. I did not hide
my beliefs, and so those people
in charge wanted me out of the
country.
When I was singing in America,
I was told I could never return
home.

##
People all over the world heard
my story. My songs and my
story helped many to see how
there was no fairness in South
Africa for those with black skin.
I decided to go on singing and
telling the truth about my
country, no matter what.

##
The world loved my music and I
was welcomed in many
countries. I won awards and
sang for important people all
over the globe. My life was
good, but something was
missing. I could not sing in my
home country, and people there
were not free.

##
Then a wonderful day dawned
when Nelson Mandela became
president of South Africa. New
people were in charge and the
unfair laws belonged to the
past. I finally went home with
new hope in my heart.

##
After that I could sing in a free,
fair country. People of different
skin colours could enjoy music
together. I helped make this
happen because I was brave
and strong. I sang the truth in
all of my songs.
