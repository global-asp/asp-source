# Acanit becomes an orphan

##
Once upon a time, there lived a chief who
had not yet got married. He lived in Ranker
village. He was kind to everyone in his
village.
One day, he decided to get married. But in
his village, there were four girls who prayed
private that they would be chosen to
become the wives of the chief. But the chief
had an eye on a girl called Tina. Tina was
beautiful and humble. She came in a very
simple family in another village.

The following day, the chief found that very
girl and asked her kindly to marry him. Tina
was silent and the chief was chocked. Tina
talked once that,' I will not give you an
answer now because I am going to ask my
elder sister and she is also my friend, she
added.
The chief was patient and he waited for an
answer to come

##
The next day, Tina went to the chief's home
to tell him an answer. The chief was
surprised to see Tina coming. When Tina
reached at the door, the chief opened the
door. The chief was very happy and excited.
He greeted her and Tina replied. Tina said
my words are not much, I only say that I
need you to be my husband. The chief
jumped and gave her a hug.

The chief asked for an excuse, Tina did.
Then, the chief entered a certain room and
brought a golden bang for Tina.
The chief said, take this bang as a sign that
you are mine. Then Tina left.
When she went back home, she packed her
things and left. She went back to the chief's
home. It was already dark.

##
As soon as she reached, the chief had already fallen a sleep. She
knocked the door at once but the chief was no where to be seen.
She knocked again. Then the chief opened the door.
