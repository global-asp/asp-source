# Sizwe's Smile

##
It had been raining for days, and
everyone was grumpy. Everyone
except Sizwe, who woke up with a
smile every morning.
“Yoh! Sizwe! That smile is magic!”
said Gogo.
“Is it for me?”
Sizwe clapped his hand over his
mouth.
“But it's MY smile, Gogo,” he
whispered.

##
His mother laughed. “Sizwe! A smile
is something you can give away
without losing it. Look!”
She lifted him up to the mirror.
There was his smile, just as bright
as before.

##
It was time to go out. Mama
buttoned up Sizwe's raincoat, and
off they went, through the rain, to
the library.
Down the street, Sizwe's best friend
Zanele stood at the window of her
house, looking sadly at the rain.
Sizwe felt his smile creeping,
creeping up.
Before he knew it, his smile LEAPT
out, and flew across the garden to
Zanele.

##
Zanele held on tightly to the smile –
it was far too precious to let it get
away.
As Sizwe walked away to the
library, Zanele's doorbell rang. It
was the postman, with a letter from
her favourite cousin.
Zanele was so happy, that the smile
bounced up, and beamed out at the
postman.
“Thank you, Mister Postman!” she
said.

##
Zanele's smile was the brightest
thing the postman had seen all
morning. It kept him warm as he
trudged off through the rain.
He came to a big house. Inside the
gate, a dog was spinning around in
circles, barking, barking, barking.
He was so silly, that the postman
couldn't help smiling.
The smile bounced through the gate
with a glitter of glee.

##
The dog stopped barking. He
pricked up his ears and wagged his
tail. Then he turned and ran back to
the house with the precious, warm
smile.
A bent old man opened the door.
“Oh, no! You can't come inside.
You're all wet!” he told the dog. But
right away, the smile beamed up at
the old man.

##
The old man stood a little straighter.
“Eish,” he said, “Who cares if it's
raining? Let's go for a walk, boy!”
And off they went, splashing in the
puddles.
There, at the zebra crossing, stood
grumpy Mrs Makabela, the traffic
cop. She looked cold, and wet, and
miserable.
The old man knew just what to do.
“Morning, Mrs Makabela!” he called,
and smiled his biggest, brightest
smile.
But Mrs Makabela… did not smile
back.

##
Standing in the rain for days can make a face sad, sad, sad.
But a smile is a magical thing and, by now, the smile was so
strong, and so bright, that it was very hard to keep inside.
It didn't work right away,
but bit by tiny bit,
it began to creep out until,
at last…!

##
A great, big smile lit up Mrs
Makabela's face!
The school bell rang, and children
ran to cross the road. Mrs Makabela
put up her sign, and smiled, and
smiled, at each and every child.

##
The children smiled at their moms
and dads, and their gogos and tatas
and brothers and sisters. They
smiled at the bus driver and the
greengrocer, and Mme Makau, who
went off to smile at her husband,
who smiled at the mayor...
The smiles leapt and rolled and
beamed and gleamed until
EVERYONE was smiling and giggling
and laughing out loud in the rain.

##
In the library, everything was quiet
except for the sound of the rain.
“It's time to go,” said Sizwe's
mother, closing her book.
“Aw, mom!” said Sizwe, who had
run out of smiles.

##
But as they stepped out into the
street…
WHAT A SIGHT!
Everyone in town was there!
Everyone!
And they were ALL smiling!

##
The smiles bounced around and
beamed at Sizwe. They warmed
him, and tickled him, and crept up,
up, up from his toes… to the TOP of
his head. He was so full of
happiness that the smile burst out,
brilliant and beaming bright.
And something changed. The dark,
gloomy, rainy afternoon didn't seem
so dark anymore.
Could it be…? YES!
The clouds parted, and the warm
sun shone down on them, with the
biggest, brightest, most brilliant
smile of all.
