# Bathtub Safari

##
Bathtime is Jack's
favourite part of
the day.
‘I'll be back in a
few moments,'
says his mom.

##
‘Make sure to clean
behind your ears.'

##
There's a SWOOSH.
And a swish of a tail.

##
And then...

##
Jack's bathtub safari begins!

##
Look at what's coming!

##
There's a twist
and a turn...
Something's
growing...
It's a...

##
Tooot!

##
There's a RUMBLE!
It's going up
UP
UP…

##
And…

##
SPLASH!

##
There's a SPLOSH.
Something bubbles.

It's time to…

##
AAAAAAH.....
But something's lurking in the background….

##
ROAR!

##
'Time to get out. I hope
you're clean and
ready for bed.'
