# Miss Helen's Magical World

##
Meet my friend Helen. She was born
in a little Karoo town called Nieu
Bethesda. There was not much
going on in this town. But she made
a whole world here. She even made
me. And she named her house after
me.
It was called 'The Owl House'.

##
Most of Helen's nine brothers and
sisters were grown up and gone by
the time she arrived. But she still
had her sisters Annie and Alida.
Helen didn't have many friends in
the village, but she didn't mind.
From the start, Helen did things
differently from most people.

##
After her sisters left home, Helen
lived alone with her parents. She
loved her mother, but she hated her
father. Everyone agreed he was a
very strange man.
Her big sister Alida travelled all over
the world. One day she sent Helen a
postcard from Egypt.
In her mind Helen saw princes and
pyramids and camels in the sand.

##
As she grew older, Helen read more
stories of faraway places. She
especially liked poems from Persia
in the Middle East.
She dreamed of visiting the ocean
one day. She kept a seashell on her
bedside table, and imagined she
could hear the sound of waves
inside it.
But of course, owls were always her
favourite things of all!

##
Helen loved books and stories so
much that she decided to become a
teacher. She was very good at it
too. But then she met Johannes
Pienaar. He was also a teacher, and
a writer and actor.
He convinced her to run away with
him.

##
Helen and Johannes got married.
They travelled to many different
towns, teaching and performing
plays. Helen thought she might
start a family like her sisters had
done. But it was not to be. She and
her husband were always fighting.
When Helen's mother became very
sick, she decided it was time to go
back home.

##
Helen was not happy. Her mother
was so sick, and her father was so
grumpy. She kept to herself. People
thought she was strange.
The night her mother died, Helen
kept a candle burning beside her
bed all night.
With the help of that little light,
Helen didn't feel so afraid of the
dark.
And remember, we owls were there
too.
We watched over her, calling woowooh!

##
Helen decided she wanted
brightness in her life. She began by
changing the space around her. She
needed helpers. Three men from
the village, Jonas Adams, Piet van
der Merwe, and Koos Malgas, made
the things she imagined out of wire
and cement. She filled her back
garden with interesting creatures.
There were sphinxes and camels,
mermaids and cats.
And lots and lots of owls! She called
it her camel yard.
On the fence she made a wire sign.
It said: "This is my world."

##
During the day Helen made
sculptures. At night, she practised
catching light.
She collected glasses and mirrors,
candles and lamps. Anything that
would shine.
She put lanterns in every room.
Mirrors caught and reflected the
light. She covered the walls in
glittering glass so that they could
shine too.
After Helen's father died, she had
the house to herself. Each night she
slept in a different room.
She would always choose the one
with the best view of the moon and
the stars.

##
The people of Nieu Bethesda would
walk past Helen's garden and
marvel at the creatures in it.
Some of the village children brought
her glass bottles for her sculptures
and called her "Miss Helen." She
always thanked them with sweets.
Others were not so friendly. They
called her names and threw stones
on her roof. Miss Helen spent all her
money on glass and cement. She
lived on bread and black tea. In her
diary she wrote:
"In my loneliness I am happy."

##
The garden grew and grew, until
there was hardly space left for any
more creatures.
Miss Helen was tired now. Her
hands were stiff and sore. Her eyes
were going blind from working with
tiny bits of glass.
She wasn't afraid of being alone.
But she was still afraid of the dark.
And her world was getting darker
and darker. She knew that soon she
wouldn't be able to see anything at
all.

##
But when she closed her eyes for
the last time, Miss Helen didn't see
darkness. She saw the sun and the
moon and the stars. She saw wise
men and mermaids, camels and
cats, acrobats and owls with big
brown glittering glass eyes.
And we still stand here today, just
the way she left us, in the garden
she made, looking East.
