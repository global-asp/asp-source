# Anansi gives people stories

##
Long, long ago, the Sky God,
Nyame, kept all stories locked in a
wooden box, high in the sky.
People down on earth had no
stories to tell and they were very
sad.
They asked Anansi the clever Spider
to help them.

##
Anansi spun a long thread, and
climbed up his sticky thread all the
way to heaven.
"Can I have the stories, please?" he
asked the Sky God.
But Nyame laughed at Anansi and
said, "Oh, these are very expensive
stories. You wouldn't be able to pay
for them, little spider."

##
"How much do the stories cost?"
asked Anansi.
"You'll have to bring me three rare
and fierce animals," Nyame
answered, "A leopard with sharp
teeth like spears, a hornet that
stings people, and a snake that
swallows people whole."
He laughed and laughed. He
thought his stories were quite safe.

##
So Anansi climbed slowly back
down his sticky thread to the earth.
He thought and he thought, and he
came up with a plan.
He dug a deep hole, covered it with
branches and dirt so it was hidden,
and he went home for supper. In the
morning, sure enough, a leopard
had fallen into his pit. He was
furiously scratching at the side of
the pit, but he couldn't get out.

##
"Oh let me help you, my dear
friend!" said Anansi. "Just lie down
on these sticks and I'll pull you out."
Anansi wound his sticky web round
the leopard and the sticks, and
pulled him up to heaven to show
the Sky God.
But Nyame just laughed and said,
"Where are the other two?"

##
So Anansi went back down to earth
to get the second creature. He
thought and he thought and he
came up with a plan.
He took a gourd full of water and
went to the tree where the hornets
lived. He poured out some of the
water all over their nest. Then he
cut a leaf from a banana tree and
held it over his head, and he poured
the rest of the water all over
himself.

##
He called out to the hornets, "Hey
hornets! Come see! It is raining!
Quick - get inside my gourd and it
will keep all of you dry."
Hornets don't like to get wet, so
they all flew into Anansi's gourd.

##
Then Anansi quickly spun a web
across the opening so the hornets
couldn't get out no matter how
much they buzzed.
He carried them up to heaven and
showed them to the Sky God.
But Nyame just said, "Where's the
last one?" (He wasn't laughing so
much anymore.)

##
So Anansi went down to earth
again. He thought and thought and
he thought, but he couldn't come
up with a plan. So he asked his wife,
who had a very good idea.
Together they found a good long
thick branch and some strong vines.
When they got near the stream
where the snake lived, they began
to argue.
"The branch is longer!"
"No, it isn't!"
"Yes it is!"

##
Soon the snake came out and asked
what the argument was.
"I was arguing with my wife," said
Anansi. "She says this stick is
longer than you are. But I don't
agree."
"Of course I'm longer than that
stick!" said the snake.
"I'm very long! I'm a huge snake!
Just put your stick next to me and
measure!"

##
So Anansi did that, and he tied the
snake to the stick with his vine to
keep him straight.
When he was all tied up, Anansi
took the snake up to heaven.

##
Nyame had to admit that Anansi
had paid his price. So he went to his
wooden box, opened the lid, and
gave all the stories to Anansi.
Anansi carried the stories
triumphantly down to earth.
He shared them with his wife, and
with all the other animals and
people.
Stories are for telling, not for
keeping in wooden boxes.
