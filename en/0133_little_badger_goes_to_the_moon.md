# Little Badger goes to the moon

##
The big bright moon rose up in the dark night sky. Little Badger was sitting under the stars,
dreaming about one day going to visit the moon.

##
Badger was a little grey dog, he had big ears and a large black and grey beard. He is a
schnauzer dog.

##
One morning at breakfast Badger said to his mother; "Mum, please can you go to the train
station and buy me a ticket to go to the moon?"
His mother laughed, "Oh dear little Badger, I am afraid you are too small to go to the moon.

His mother laughed, "Oh little Badger! You are to small to go to the moon!"

##
When Badger was at school his teacher asked the class what they want to be when they
grow up. Badger put his paw up and said, "Miss Trudy, I want to go to the moon."
The class and Miss Trudy laughed; "Oh dear little Badger! I am afraid that the aliens will
catch you!"

##
Not ready to give up yet, Badger asked Peppy Pig. "Peppy, I really want to go to the
moon.Can you help me?" asked Badger.
Peppy laughed so much, he almost fell off his chair. "Oh dear little Badger! I am afraid that
your big beard will not fit into your space helmet!"

##
Badger was sad. All he wanted to do was go to the moon. He thought if his friends won't
help him go to the moon, he will find someone who can. So he left home and walked far and
wide to find a friend who loved the moon.

##
Badger walked down the hill, through a scary forest, crossed over an old bridge and finally
swam through a very deep river. He then saw a house.
It was Grandpa Garry's house.

##
"Grandpa Garry, I am so to see you!" he said. "I want to go to the moon! Mum says I am too
small, Miss Trudy said the aliens will catch me and Peppy said my beard was too big! What
can I do now?"

##
Grandpa Garry smiled at Badger and said, "Oh dear little Badger! Not to worry, we will go to
the moon together." Badger was excited.

##
Grandpa Garry went behind his house and pulled out a large box.
"Are you ready to make our spaceship Badger?" laughed Grandpa Garry.

##
Badger was so excited he jumped in the air, "To
infinity and beyond!!" he cried.
