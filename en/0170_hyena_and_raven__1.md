# Hyena and Raven

##
Hyena and Raven were once great
friends, even though they were
quite different in some ways.
Raven could fly but Hyena was only
able to walk.

##
One day Hyena, curious to know
something about his friend, asked
Raven, “What is this white thing
which is always below your neck?”

Raven answered, “It is the fatty meat which I usually eat in the sky.
I have been eating it for so long now it is stuck on my neck.”
On hearing about meat, saliva started pouring out of Hyena's
mouth for he was greedy and he loved meat very much.
Hyena really wanted to eat that meat. But how could he reach the
meat in the sky if he had no wings to fly?
“Please my friend,” he asked Raven, “lend me some feathers so
that I can make myself some wings. I really want to be able to fly
like you.”

##
Raven was not mean, so he gave
him some feathers.
Hyena sewed them together into
wings. He fastened them to his
body, and tried to take off into the
sky.
But he was far too heavy for the
few feathers to carry him.
So he had to think of another plan.

##
“Please my friend,” he asked Raven,
“could I hold onto your tail as you
fly up into the sky?”
“All right,” said Raven. “I know how
much you want to fly. Let's do it
tomorrow morning.”
When day came, Hyena took hold of
Raven's tail and Raven flew up into
the sky.

##
Raven flew and flew and flew until
he was exhausted. But Hyena said,
“Just a little further, my friend!”
He could see the white and fatty
meat just above them, and his
mouth was watering.

##
When they reached the first piece of fatty meat, Hyena felt a jerk.
One of Raven's tail feathers came off in his hand! Then there was
another jerk, and another. Raven felt much lighter, and the ache in
his tail was going.
He sang:
Raven's feathers, unpluck yourselves. Raven's feathers, unpluck
yourselves.
In response, Hyena sang the opposite:
Raven's feathers hold on, don't unpluck yourselves. Raven's
feathers hold on, don't unpluck yourselves.

##
Finally, the feathers could not hold
Hyena anymore. He was in the
middle of nowhere in the sky.
He jumped onto the fatty meat
thinking that as he ate, the fatty
meat would hold him. But as he
tried to hold and eat the ‘meat', all
he felt was moist cloud!

##
By now he was falling fast. “Help,
help!” he shouted.
But no one could hear him. Raven
was lost in the clouds.

##
Hyena fell on the ground with a
crash and lay silent for some
minutes.
He woke up howling in pain, with a
broken leg and dark scars all over
his body.

##
From that day to now, Hyena limps
and he has many scars on his body.
He has never been able to fly.
And he and Raven are no longer
friends.
