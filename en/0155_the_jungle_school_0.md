# The Jungle School

##
There was a dark jungle.

##
It was a big dark jungle.
There were lots of trees and a
narrow path.
Many animals and birds lived
here.

##
One day, all the animals came together.
"Did you hear?" asked Tota, the parrot.
"Yes," said Hirni, the deer.
"What?" asked Darpok, the rabbit.
"We have a school in the jungle," answered
Zhoola, the monkey.
Mota, the elephant wondered, "Hmph?"
Lamboo, the giraffe said, "Oh, good!"
Dheema, the snail squealed, "Hurry, let's go!"

##
Tota, the parrot flew ahead.
Zhoola, the monkey jumped from tree to tree.
Poorakha, the python slithered fast.
"Here!" shouted Tota. "Can you read?"
"It is upside down, I think," said Zhoola
hanging by the branch.
Poorakha concluded, "Hisssss. No one can
read."

##
Soon, all the other friends joined them.
Lamboo looked over the tree.
"No one here," he said.
Zhoola repeated, "No one here."
Tota proposed, "Look carefully!"
Pilloo, the little bear declared, "I found a
room!"

##
"I found a swing", announced Dheema.
"What are these blocks?" Darpok wanted to
know.
"What is this?" was Zhoola's question.
Poorakha explained, "I believe, this is a pencil."

##
Moto and Lamboo found a classroom.
They called the others, "Look, what is this?"
Everyone came with school bags.
They began shouting, "Teacher! Teacher!
Where is our teacher?"
No one knew.

##
Then they heard a roar.
They heard a loud roar.
They heard a louder roar.
Poorakha was worried.
Dheema was scared.
Tota hid behind the board.
Lamboo and Zhoola were puzzled.

##
Who is this?
"Hup!" said Zhoola the monkey.
No one spoke.
They all looked at the teacher.
Up and down carefully.
Then they looked at one another.

##
The teacher turned to write on the black board.
"Jump," said Zhoola.
"Fly! said Tota.
Thump, thump, thump ran Mota.
"Run, run run fast," screamed Dheema.
"Bhagoooo," they all shouted together.
When the teacher turned...
There was no one in the class.
