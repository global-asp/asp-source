# Angel the lucky girl

##
One day, Angel was sent to the market to
buy some tomatoes .She looked for the
tomatoes and they were no where to be
found .As she delayed ,her mother got more
angrier because they both did not like her
.By the time she arrived ,it was already
midnight .When she entered the house ,her
mother bet her and threw her out .As she
was outside ,a young man came and carried
her up on a horse and took her to a nearby
palace .

Once upon a time, there lived a girl called
Angel .She lived with her step mother and
her sister called Josephine . They both lived
in Kikuboo village and they both did not go
to school .Angel was always sent every thing
they needed while Josephine her sister was
just doing nothing.

The guard opened the gate while giving him
respect .Angel did not no what was going
on. What she didn't know is that the young
man who was riding her was a prince and he
was about to marry but he didn't have
anyone to marry .Therefore he married her
and they lived together happily as a couple.
One Friday morning ,they were attacked by
a gang thieves. These thieves did not have
any thing to steal but gold .They entered the
palace with big bags .

What Angel didn't know was that the prince
was a great fighter and all the people feared
him at fighting and that is why most people
feared him and followed his orders .He killed
the thieves and hanged them on ropes in
the centre of the palace and all the people
began to praise him for what he had done
.All the people became happy again
including the prince and the princes.
