# Punishment

##
One day, mama got a
lot of fruit.

##
"When can we have
some fruit?" we ask.
"We will eat the fruit
tonight," says mama.

##
My brother Rahim is
greedy. He tastes all the
fruit. He eats a lot of it.

##
"Look at what Rahim
did!" shouts my little
brother. "Rahim is
naughty and selfish," I
say.

##
Mother is angry with
Rahim.

##
We are also angry with
Rahim. But Rahim is not
sorry.

##
"Aren't you going to
punish Rahim?" asks
little brother.

##
"Rahim, soon you will
be sorry," warns mama.

##
Rahim starts to feel
sick.

##
"My tummy is so sore,"
whispers Rahim.

##
Mama knew this would
happen. The fruit is
punishing Rahim!

##
Later, Rahim says sorry
to us. "I will never be so
greedy again," he
promises. And we all
believe him.
