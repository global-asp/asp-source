# Lion's fire sticks

##
This story starts in the old times
when animals and people lived
together. In those days people did
not have the right to fire. They ate
their food raw.
Only Lion had the power of fire.

##
The people and the animals came
together to make a plan. “What can
we do to get the fire from Lion so
that we can cook our food?” they
asked.
They decided to wait until evening
and started singing and singing,
clapping and clapping, calling
everyone together.
“Come dance with us.
Come dance with us.
Come dance with us.”

##
Many animals came from the bush
to join in the dancing and singing.
Lion brought his fire sticks. He
rubbed the sticks, rubbed and
rubbed. Soon a little smoke
appeared beneath the sticks. Lion
blew on the smoke and added some
dry grass.
A little flame appeared and
everyone brought a piece of wood.
Soon everyone was dancing around
a fire.

##
Rabbit was a cunning and fast
animal. The people said to him,
“While we are singing here and
while Lion is dancing with us, you
must take his fire sticks and run.”
So Rabbit grabbed Lion's fire sticks
and ran. He did not make it because
Lion caught up with him and
brought the fire sticks back.

##
The lion sang a boastful song:
“To me it does not matter.
I don't have a problem.
I can eat you with hair,
I can eat you without hair.
I don't have a problem.
All of you are food to me.”

##
Springbok could run and jump very
fast. The people said to him, “While
Lion is dancing and singing here
with us, you must grab his fire
sticks and run.”

##
When they were dancing and
singing, Springbok grabbed the fire
sticks and jumped away into the
veld. But Lion said, “Why do I not
hear the clippety-clop clippety-clop
of Springbok's hooves behind me?”

##
Lion turned and saw Springbok
running into the veld with his fire
sticks. So he ran after Springbok,
caught him and came back with his
fire sticks.
Again, Lion sang his boastful song.

##
Then the people whispered to each
other. They said, “Let us ask Duiker.
He is small and very fast.” “Duiker,”
they said, “while Lion is dancing
and singing here with us, you must
grab his fire sticks and run away.”

##
When they were dancing around the
fire, Duiker grabbed Lion's fire
sticks and ran into the veld. But
Lion said, “Why do I not hear Duiker
snort-snorting behind me as
before?”
He turned around and chased after
little Duiker who was leaping into
the veld. Lion caught up with him
and returned to the fire with his
sticks.

##
Again, Lion sang his boastful song.
“To me it does not matter.
I don't have a problem.
I can eat you with hair,
I can eat you without hair.
I don't have a problem.
All of you are food to me.”

##
“Oh,” sighed the people, “Which
animal can help us now? Ostrich
has the longest legs of all, let us ask
him.” They explained the plan to
Ostrich and he grabbed Lion's fire
sticks this time.

##
Lion said, “Why do I not hear
Ostrich's high singing voice behind
me anymore?” He looked around,
saw Ostrich and chased after him.

##
After a long time, Lion returned with
a tired face, for Ostrich ran too fast
for him. “From this day on,” he said,
“I will not leave any of you alone. I
will hunt you and chase you and eat
you!”
And this is how Lion came to be
everyone's enemy and how people
got the power of fire.
