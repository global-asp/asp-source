# Dog and Crocodile

##
One day at the river, Dog came across some eggs in the sand. He asked himself, "Which animal left these eggs here?"

##
He counted ten eggs and thought they might belong to Duck. He put them in his bag.

##
He took the eggs home and put them in a warm place.

##
When Dog returned to the river, he met Crocodile. She asked, "Have you seen my eggs?""I don’t know anything about your eggs," he replied.

##
Crocodile started visiting all the animals asking about her eggs.

##
Meanwhile, the eggs hatched one by one.

##
Dog did his best to look after the baby crocodiles, but there was never enough food. The young crocodiles were always hungry.

##
One day Crocodile went to Dog’s house looking for her eggs. As she stood outside, she heard the rumbling of little crocodile bellies!

##
Crocodile stormed inside and hit Dog with her tail. Dog yelped and jumped through the window.

##
Crocodile chased Dog all the way to the river.

##
Dog cried, "I’m sorry, I didn’t know they were your eggs!" 

##
Crocodile believed him and forgave him. She took her offspring for their first swimming lesson.
