# Hare and Tortoise (Again!)

##
Do you remember the Great Race
between the hare and the tortoise?
For a long time, no one in the entire
animal kingdom could talk about
anything but the Great Race and its
two contestants.

##
We all know that the rabbit was defeated because he was lazy and
overconfident.
We know that the tortoise won the race because he was slow and
steady. The forest animals knew this too, and continued to respect
both creatures equally.
Even the two competitors remained friends. The tortoise did not
assume airs because he had won, and the hare, realising he had
been defeated fair and square, bore the tortoise no grudge.

##

##
Many months passed. The king of
the jungle where the hare and the
tortoise lived had some important
matters to discuss with the king of
the neighbouring jungle.
But the first king could not leave his
jungle just then. He decided,
instead, to send the hare and
tortoise to the neighbouring king, as
his representatives.

##
"At least one of you must go to the neighbouring
kingdom," ordered the king, when the hare and the
tortoise had presented themselves.
"I want you to discuss certain important matters with
the king there, and come back to me with his
thoughts on those matters."
"Now go!" he said, as he dismissed them. "And mind,
you only have a day to complete the task."

##

##
The road to the neighbouring
kingdom was not smooth or easy.
It was rocky and full of thorns.
There were also two rivers to cross
on the way.

##

##
After some thought, both the hare
and the tortoise realised that
neither of them could complete the
task alone.
They had to travel together.
The plan was for the hare to carry
the tortoise over the thorny parts of
the route, and for the tortoise to
carry the hare across the two rivers.

##
The next day, they collected the
various messages from their king
and were ready to go.
The hare made short work of the
thorny parts of the route with his
giant loping strides, while the
tortoise held on for dear life.

##
When they came to a river, they
switched places, and the hare
clambered onto the tortoise's back.
The tortoise swam across the river
gracefully.
Once both rivers had been crossed,
it did not take them long to arrive at
the neighbouring kingdom.

##

##
After long discussions with the
neighbouring king on all the
matters raised by their own king,
the hare and the tortoise were
ready to leave.

##
The journey home was even
smoother than the outward journey,
since both the hare and the tortoise
now knew exactly what to do.
The two old rivals had worked so
well that they reached the king well
ahead of the deadline he had set!
