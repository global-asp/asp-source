# Anansi and Turtle

##
One day, Anansi the spider picked
some yams from his garden.
They were extra beautiful delicious
yams, so he baked them carefully in
the fire.
Then he sat down to eat them up.

##
Just as Anansi was about to put the
first bite in his mouth, he heard a
knock on his door. “Oh, no!”
thought Anansi. “Who can that be?”
But he opened the door.
There was Turtle, who looked very
tired. Turtle said, “Anansi, please let
me in. I've walked so far today, and
I'm so tired and hungry.”
So what could Anansi do but let him
in?

##
Anansi was too selfish to share his
beautiful delicious yams with
anybody else. So he came up with a
nasty plan.
Just as Turtle sat down at the table
and began to reach for some yams,
Anansi yelled at him, “Turtle, your
hands are all dirty! You can't eat
with your hands all dirty! Go wash
them.”
Turtle's hands really were dirty. So
he slowly crawled to the river,
washed his hands, and then crawled
back.

##
But meanwhile Anansi had started
gobbling up the yams. By the time
Turtle got back, he saw that the
yams were all gone.
Turtle looked at Anansi. “Thank you
for inviting me to dinner. If you're
ever near my house, please come
by and let me return the favour,”
said Turtle.
And Turtle began crawling slowly
away to his house.

##
As time went by, Anansi began to
think more and more about how
Turtle had promised to feed him a
free dinner. So one day he walked
over to Turtle's house.
Anansi got to Turtle's house just
about dinnertime, as the sun was
going down over the river. Turtle
was lying on a rock in the sun,
warming himself up, as turtles do.
When Turtle saw Anansi, he said,
“Hello there, Anansi, have you
come to have dinner with me?”
And Anansi said, “Yes, that would
be very nice, thank you.” He was
getting hungrier and hungrier.

##
So Turtle dived down to the bottom
of the river to set the table for
dinner and get everything ready.
Anansi waited on the rocks by the
shore.
Soon Turtle swam back up and said,
“Oh Anansi, it is all ready now,
please join me for dinner.” And
Turtle dived down again and began
to eat the green leaves he had for
dinner.

##
Anansi tried to dive down to the
bottom of the river, but he was a
spider, not a turtle, and he couldn't
dive that deep. He kept floating
back up to the surface again.
He tried jumping in, he tried diving
in, but nothing helped. He just
couldn't get down to that dinner.

##
Finally Anansi had an idea. He put
lots of stones in the pockets of his
coat, and finally he was heavy
enough to sink down to the bottom
of the river.
How clever he was!
He saw Turtle's table, full of juicy
green leaves and lots of other
delicious food. Anansi's mouth was
watering.

##
But just as Anansi was reaching for
some of that delicious food, Turtle
stopped him. “Anansi, surely you're
not going to eat dinner with your
coat on? That's not how we do
things at my house.”
Anansi, without thinking, said, “Oh,
of course you're right, Turtle, what
was I thinking?” He took off his
coat.

##
But without the rocks in his pockets
to hold him down, Anansi floated
right back to the surface of the river
again, and popped out of the water.
Anansi sadly put his head down into
the water and watched Turtle eat up
all of the delicious food!
