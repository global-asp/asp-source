# Sunday at the park

##
We are in Cape Town on
holiday. We are excited
because Mom and Dad
are taking us to the
park next to the sea.

##
Look at the tall slide.
Am I brave enough to
climb up and slide
down?

##
My sister and I want to
play on the see saw. I
wonder which one of us
is heaviest?

##
Mom and Dad need to
push us when we want
to swing. I am going to
try to swing the
highest.

##
Look at these white
horses. They are
statues.

##
We read the sign which
shows us what fun we
can have with the
horses.

##
We visit the lighthouse.
Mom and Dad say it is
very old.

##
Lighthouses are
important at night and
in the fog. They alert
ships to the rocks in the
sea.

##
We have had a happy
time at the park, but
now it is home time. We
are going to catch a
bus.

##
Thank you Mom and
Dad for our treat. We
are tired but very
happy!
