# My red ball

##
Ball.

##
My ball.

##
My red ball.

##
My big red ball.

##
I kick.

##
I kick my ball.

##
I kick my red ball.

##
I kick my red ball hard!

##
Where?

##
Where is my ball?

##
Where is my ball now?

##
Where is my red ball
now?

##
It is up.

##
It is high up.

##
It is high up in the sky.

##
It is high up in the sky.
It is over the moon.
It is gone!
