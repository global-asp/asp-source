# Queen of Soweto: The Story of Basetsana Kumalo

##
Basetsana Makgalemele was born
in a township called Soweto. She
was her parents' third daughter.
They named her Basetsana, which
means “girls”. In Tswana culture,
calling your daughter that means
your next child will be a boy. This
actually happened. Her parents'
next child was a boy. Her parents,
big sisters and younger brother all
called her Bassie for short.

##
When she was a child, Bassie was
very shy. She liked to sing and
dance in her room on her own.
One day at school netball practice,
the coach told two girls to pick
teams. Bassie stood on the edge of
the field hoping someone would
say, “Come play with us!” But
nobody wanted her on their team.
Little did they know, Bassie would
become one of the most popular
girls in the country.

##
On weekends, she and her brother
and sisters helped their teacher
mom and bus driver dad to pay the
bills. They made sandwiches to sell
at local soccer matches. They tried
to sell everything as fast as they
could so they had time to play with
the other children when the game
was over.

##
By the time Bassie turned 16, she
was a beautiful young woman. She
was so beautiful that she won two
beauty competitions in one year:
Miss Soweto and Miss Black South
Africa.
But Bassie was not only beautiful on
the outside. She was also beautiful
on the inside. Even though she was
a beauty queen, she still cared
about the community where she
grew up.

##
Bassie was also very smart. She
worked hard at school, especially on
her favourite subject: science. Her
hard work was rewarded when she
was the top science student at her
school in matric. That's not all, she
was also Head Girl. The shy little
girl was now one of the most
popular girls in school.

##
Bassie's father always encouraged
his children to read. He gave her a
book called The Power of Positive
Thinking. From that book, she learnt
that being optimistic is the key to
making your dreams a reality. She
dreamt of winning Miss South
Africa. Not only did that dream
come true, she was even crowned
First Princess in the Miss World
competition!

##
Bassie's mother was her role model.
Bassie described her mom as a
“fierce, hardworking Xhosa woman
who did not suffer fools”. She was a
teacher and Bassie had plans to
follow in her footsteps, but things
don't always go as planned! After
winning Miss South Africa, she
became a TV presenter. She wasn't
a teacher, but like her mom, she
was hardworking. Her career in TV
led to her opening her own
television production company. She
was now a successful business
woman.

##
Bassie's motto is: “To whom much
is given, much is expected.” She
believes that you are given a gift so
that you can give to others. Bassie
does this by volunteering, giving of
her time and money and even
creating jobs. She is involved with
projects and charities to help
people in her community. One that
is very close to her heart is the
Nelson Mandela Institute.

##
Bassie had a very close relationship
with Nelson Mandela. When she was
crowned Miss South Africa, Madiba
wrote her a letter of
congratulations. In the letter, he
called her “our Queen”. They shared
a passion for children and education
and the belief that an educated
nation can help fight poverty.

##
Bassie married Romeo Kumalo and
became known as Basetsana
Kumalo.
Together they established the
Romeo & Basetsana Kumalo Family
Foundation. The foundation looks
after orphans - children who don't
have a mom and dad.

##
Bassie has had to learn to balance
her busy work and family life.
She has her own company called
Basetsana Women Investment
Holdings. She and Romeo have
three children, two boys and a girl.
Bassie sees her role as mother to
her children as her “highest calling
and greatest privilege”.

##
Bassie says the secret to her
success is “courage, determination,
passion and staying committed to
the course”. Despite all her
success, she remains humble while
trying to make the world a better
place.
Being beautiful on the outside is not
what makes you a beautiful person.
It's a heart filled with love and
generosity. And that's why Bassie is
our beautiful Queen.
