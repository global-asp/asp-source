# Kisirusiru, the foolish one

##
Once upon a time, there was a
farmer and his wife who had only
one child, a boy called Kisirusiru.

##
One day as Kisirusiru was taking the
goats out, a goat's horn tore his
shirt.
His mother sent him to the shop to
buy a needle so that he could mend
his shirt. Kisirusiru bought the
needle and put it in the pocket of
his shirt.

##
As he was going home, he found
boys playing football and joined
them. The needle fell out of his
pocket and got lost.
When he reached home he told his
mother what had happened.
“My child,” said his mother, “next
time put the needle on a piece of
paper.”
“Yes mother, I understand,” replied
Kisirusiru.

##
The next day, the boy picked up a pot to go and fetch water. He
remembered what his mother said, and wrapped the pot in a piece
of paper to carry it back home.
But on the way the paper got torn and the pot fell down and broke
into pieces, spilling the water on the ground.
When he got home, his mother patiently explained, “My child, next
time put the pot on your head. Then you'll be able to carry it
without spilling.”
“Yes mother, I understand,” said Kisirusiru.

##

##
The following day, Kisirusiru's father
told him to take the goats out to
graze.
He remembered what his mother
had said, and put the goat on his
head.
The goat kicked and scratched
Kisirusiru's head. Soon blood was
pouring down his face.
“When will you stop your stupidity?”
said his father, exasperated.
“Goats are tied and pulled with
ropes! If you can't behave properly,
you'll have to leave this house.”

##
The next day, the man sent his son
to go buy some meat at the market.
Remembering what his father said,
Kisirusiru tied a rope around the
meat and started pulling it home.
He ran very fast so as not to keep
his father waiting.
Imagine how the meat looked when
it reached home?

##
His father was so angry he told him
to pack his things and go away.
When his mother heard this, she
decided to leave with her son.
When they left, they took the
kitchen door with them - to have
something to start building a new
house.

##
They had walked for quite a while
but could not find anywhere to build
their new house.
When it became dark, they decided
to climb up a tree and sleep.

##
They had just climbed the tree,
pulling the door up after them,
when they heard noises down
below.
They saw three dangerous looking
men with huge sacks.
They were so scared that they let
go of the door. It crashed to the
ground, terrifying the men so much
that they ran away leaving
everything behind.

##
Kisirusiru and his mother climbed
down the tree.
When they opened the sacks, they
found money, clothes, blankets,
everything they needed to set up
house.
They soon found a place to build
themselves a new house, and lived
happily ever after.
