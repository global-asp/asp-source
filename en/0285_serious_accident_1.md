# Serious accident

##
One day my sister and I
were walking near the
road.

##
A big truck was driving
down the hill.

##
A car was speeding up
the hill.

##
The truck driver was
talking on his cell
phone.
He was not looking at
the road.

##
The truck smashed into
the car!

##
An ambulance and the
police came to help.

##
Two tow trucks came.
One towed the truck.
The other towed the
car.

##
We saw everything.
We were shocked.
