# Bunty and Bubbly

##
Bunty loves to play with
butterflies...

##
...and with birds.

##
She loves to play with
paper boats.

##
She also likes to make
sand castles.

##
When Bunty goes back
home, her mother asks
her to clean up. She
refuses.

##
"I hate soap!" she
screams.

##
One night, she has a
dream. The germs are
all around her castle,
and are attacking her.

##
Bunty is chased by the
germs.
She runs for her life and
screams, "Help...help!"

##
Suddenly, Soap King
Bubbly appears.
"Bunty, don't be afraid,"
he says.
"Go attack the germs!"
the Soap King orders
his army of bubbles.

##
The army of bubbles
chases the germs away.

##
These days, Bunty likes
to use soap, and she
brushes and scrubs
herself clean.
