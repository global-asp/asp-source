# Graca's dream

##
Graça was about to be born in a
small village in Mozambique. The
country was poor and the people
did not yet rule themselves.
Children didn't have good schools
and many couldn't read. Graça's
mother dreamed of giving her
children better opportunities. But
without education there was little
hope.

##
Baby Graça would be the sixth
child. But with this joyous event
there was great sadness. Their
beloved father was dying. He
dreamed that his youngest
daughter would go to a good
school. He knew that education
would give her opportunities he
never had. His family promised to
make their dad's dream come true.

##
Just weeks after their dad died, the
new baby was born. She was given
a name to match the beauty and
blessing that she was – Graça. As
the years passed, Graça brought
much joy to her family and they
kept the promise made to their
father. Graça would have a good
education.

##
Graça worked hard at school and as
a teenager she received a gift that
would change her life. It was a
scholarship to attend a rich city
school.
She dreamed of becoming a teacher
and using her education to educate
others. She wanted the children of
her beloved Mozambique to know
reading and learning. She dreamed
of a time when all children would go
to school.

##
Graça did her best in that city
school and years later she was
blessed again. It was another
scholarship to attend a university in
faraway Portugal. She met new
friends, learned new languages and
read a bounty of books. She
realised her dream of becoming a
teacher.
All this made Graça very happy.
There was only one thing that still
made her sad…

##
Back at home people were still not
free. But now Graça had an
education, skills, and hope. She also
had friends who felt as she did
about children's right to learn. She
would use her knowledge and work
with her friends. Together they
would bring change to Mozambique.

##
Finally with the help of all her
friends, Mozambique was free!

##
The man chosen to lead the country
was Graça's friend, Samora Machel.
They fell in love and got married.

##
Graça was given the important job
of making sure that all children in
Mozambique got a good education.
It was a hard job because there
were so many children in
Mozambique who couldn't read. She
knew that they needed education
and wanted to make real change in
her country. She started with
primary schools and getting boys
and girls into classrooms. Literacy
was her focus and putting books
into children's hands.

##
Graça and Samora had two
children. They shared a dream to
create good lives for their own
family and for the Mozambican
people. They were happy and
hopeful.
Then one terrible day, Samora died
in an aeroplane crash.

##
Graça mourned Samora for many
years, but she found love again.
She met a man who had also spent
his life dreaming of bringing
freedom, hope and education to his
people.
Graça married Nelson Mandela and
together they worked to help
Africa's children.
