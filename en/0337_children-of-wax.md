# Children of wax

##
Once upon a time,
there lived a happy
family.

##
They never fought with
each other. They helped
their parents at home
and in the fields.

##
But they were not
allowed to go near a
fire.

##
They had to do all their
work during the night.

Because they were made of wax!

##
But one of the boys
longed to go out in the
sunlight.

##
One day the longing
was too strong. His
brothers warned him...

##
But it was too late!
He melted in the hot
sun.

##
The wax children were
so sad to see their
brother melting away.

##
But they made a plan.
They shaped the lump
of melted wax into a
bird.

##
They took their bird
brother up to a high
mountain.

##
And as the sun rose, he
flew away singing into
the morning light.
