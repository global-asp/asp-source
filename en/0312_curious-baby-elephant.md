# Curious Baby Elephant

##
Everyone knows that the elephant has a very long nose.

##
But a long time ago, the elephant's nose was short and fat. Like a shoe in the middle of its face.

##
One day a baby elephant was born. She was curious about everything. She had a question for every animal.

##
She was curious about Giraffe. "Why do you have a long neck?" she asked.

##
She was curious about Rhino. "Why does your horn have a sharp point?"

##
She was curious about Hippo. "Why do you have red eyes?" she asked.

##
And she was VERY curious about Crocodile. "What does Crocodile eat for dinner?" she asked.

##
"Never ask a question like that!" said her mother. Then she walked off, frowning.

##
Quickly Crow flew down to baby elephant. "Follow me to the river. There you will see what Crocodile eats for dinner," squawked Crow.

##
So the baby elephant followed Crow down to the river.

##
She pushed through the reeds and stood on the bank. She looked into the water. Where was Crocodile?

##
"Hello," said a stone near the river bank. "Hello," said Baby Elephant. "Can you tell me what Crocodile eats for dinner?" she asked.

##
"Bend down and I will tell you," said the stone. "Lower, lower," said the stone. So Baby Elephant bent down lower, and lower.

##
Then suddenly, "Snap!" Baby Elephant's nose was caught in Crocodile's jaws. "Crocodile will eat you for dinner!" squawked Crow, and flew away.

##
Baby Elephant sat back on her strong legs and pulled. She pulled, and pulled. But Crocodile did not let go of her nose.

##
Baby Elephant's nose stretched, and stretched, and stretched. Then, "Thud!" she fell on her back.

##
Crocodile sunk back into the water. He was cross about losing his dinner.

##
Baby Elephant looked at her nose. It was stretched very long. She could not see where it ended!

##
Her nose was so long she could pick fruit from high branches.

##
Her nose was so long she could shower her back with water. From that day, all elephants had long and useful trunks.
