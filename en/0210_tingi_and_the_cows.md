# Tingi and the Cows

##
Tingi lived with his
grandmother.

##
He used to look after
the cows with her.

##
One day the soldiers
came.

##
They took the cows
away.

##
Tingi and his
grandmother ran away
and hid.

##
They hid in the bush
until night.

##
Then the soldiers
came back.

##
Grandmother hid Tingi
under the leaves.

##
One of the soldiers put
his foot right on him,
but he kept quiet.

##
When it was safe, Tingi
and his grandmother
came out.

##
They crept home very
quietly.
