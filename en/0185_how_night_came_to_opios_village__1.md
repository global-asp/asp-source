# How night came to Opio's village

##
Long ago, there was no night in
Opio's village.
People slept when they were tired
and worked when they were awake.

##
One day Opio went out hunting with
his dogs. After a short time, his
dogs started to chase an antelope.
Opio followed them. He ran for
many hours.
Every time he became tired, he
rested. Then he would run again.
But he could not find his dogs.

##
After many days, he came to a
village. He went to one of the
houses and said to the owner, “I
have chased an antelope for a long
time and I am very tired. I want to
rest.”
The man said, “Sit down and rest.
Would you like some beer?”
Opio was very thirsty so he drank
some. Then he went to sleep.

##
When he woke up, he couldn't see.
He opened and closed his eyes
many times.
“You have given me something very
bad to drink,” he said to the man. “I
can't see properly anymore!”
“There is nothing wrong with you,”
the man replied. “It's night now.
Haven't you ever seen night? When
the day leaves, the night comes.”

##
Opio asked many questions about
the night. He began to like it very
much.
He and his new friend talked until
morning.
He stayed for another day so that
he could see the night come again.

##
The next morning he asked his
friend,
“How can I take the night to my
own village? I want my people to
see the night.”
“When it starts to get dark this
evening, walk to your village. If you
look straight in front, the night will
follow you. But you must not look
back. If you look back, the night will
go away.”

##
Opio did as he was told. That
evening, he began to walk towards
his village.
He felt the dark night behind him as
he walked.
He wanted to look back.
But he did not.

##
When he came to his village, the
villagers were afraid.
“What disease have you brought to
us, Opio?” they asked. “What is this
dark thing following you?”
Opio said, “My friends, this dark
thing is called night. Now you are
afraid and I was afraid, too.”

##
“But you will learn to like the night.
When the light comes we can work
and when night comes, we can
rest.”

##
And that is how night came to Opio's village.
