# The Moon and the Cap

##
All of us went to the fun
fair.

##
Father bought brother
fancy glasses.
Mother bought me a
bright blue cap.
The baby got sugar
candy.

##
On the way home, a
very strong wind came.
It blew my cap away.

##
My cap got stuck on a
branch of a big old tree.

##
I cried a lot.
And I did not eat my
dinner.

##
Later that night, the
moon came up. It
looked at my cap in the
big old tree.

##
The moon tried on my
cap. It smiled happily.
I had to smile too.

##
After school the next
day, my mother gave
me a shiny new red
cap.
"The moon sent it," she
said.

##
That night, both the
moon and I wore our
caps and smiled.
We were happy.

##
Do you think the sun
needs a hat?

##
Guess which cap I am
wearing today!
