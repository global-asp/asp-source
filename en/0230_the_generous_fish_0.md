# The generous fish

##
Once upon a time there was a very
rich man called Mpunzi. He had a
wife and one daughter called
Nosisa. Mpunzi wanted a son, but
he and his wife could not have any
more children. Mpunzi blamed his
wife for not giving him a son. He
bullied his wife and treated her like
a child.

##
One day Mpunzi was very angry and
he hit his wife with a stick. She ran
away back to her family. She left
with a sad heart because Mpunzi
did not let her take Nosisa with her.
Mpunzi bullied his daughter in the
same way he bullied his wife.
Nosisa lived a very sad life.

##
Mpunzi decided to marry another
wife. He hoped that the new wife
would give him a baby boy.
Nosisa's life became even more
difficult when her father married
again. Mpunzi scolded her all the
time and made her serve the new
wife. Nosisa worked like a slave.

##
Mpunzi was very proud of his cattle. He used to sit outside his
homestead and watch his cattle grazing in the field. He felt very
satisfied with his wealth.
Mpunzi's many servants cleaned around the homestead, and
looked after his goats, cattle and sheep. They milked the cows for
fresh milk that Mpunzi sold to other villagers.

##

##
Mpunzi loved his new wife very
much. He treated her like a queen.
She sat inside her hut all day and
gave orders to Nosisa and the
servants. Nosisa woke up early
every day to make tea for her
stepmother. She cleaned her hut
and cooked for her, but her
stepmother always complained that
her food was cold, her tea was
weak, and her hut was not clean.

##
One day Mpunzi became very angry at Nosisa. He
scolded her and hit her with a stick. Nosisa ran off to
the river where she sat and cried the whole
afternoon.
Suddenly she heard a voice coming out of the river.
She looked up and saw a big fish. The voice was
coming from the fish. Nosisa was so shocked she
almost ran away, but the fish stopped her. “Please
don't run away my daughter, I am your mother. I
have changed myself into a fish so that your father
does not know it's me.”

##
“What is the matter?” asked the
fish. Nosisa told the fish everything
about her sad life. “Don't worry my
girl. I will bring you food every day,”
said the fish. The fish gave fresh
vegetables to Nosisa. She had a
feast. When she looked up the fish
was gone. That day Nosisa went
home smiling. She would not have
to go to bed without food as usual.

##
Nosisa went to the river every day. In the morning
she woke up as usual and did her chores around the
house. At midday, she went to the river. She called
out every time, and every time the fish would appear
with delicious food. Nosisa became happier and
happier. She could talk to the fish about anything.
She started to regain her health. Her skin was
glowing and she was a happy child.

##
Nosisa visited the fish every day until her stepmother
became suspicious. Nosisa had gained weight and
she was glowing. “Something is going on at the river,
I must find out what it is,” thought the stepmother.
One afternoon she followed Nosisa to the river. She
saw Nosisa talking to the fish, and getting delicious
food. Nosisa's secret was out. “I have to do
something about this fish,” said the stepmother.

##
In the evening, Mpunzi came back from the fields. He
found his new wife crying in her hut. “What is wrong
my lovely wife,” asked Mpunzi.
“I went to a traditional doctor,” said the wife. “He
told me that the only way for me to give you a son is
to eat the biggest fish that lives in this nearby river,”
she said. “Will you catch the fish for me tonight?”
pleaded the woman.
“I will do anything for you my beautiful wife,” said
Mpunzi.

##
Mpunzi set off to the river before it was too dark. He
took his servants to help him find the biggest fish in
that river. They searched and searched and
eventually Mpunzi caught the biggest fish. He put it
in a bag and went home with it. When he got to the
house, there was a good hot fire ready to cook the
fish.
“I will make the best meal ever for us,” said the
woman to Mpunzi. “You are the bravest and
strongest man I know.”
Mpunzi was very pleased with himself.

##
That night Mpunzi and his wife went to bed happy
after their delicious meal. They left the bones on the
table for Nosisa to clean in the morning.
When Nosisa brought coffee into their hut in the
morning they were still sleeping. “This is very
strange,” she thought to herself. “My father usually
wakes up very early in the morning to go to the
fields. I wonder why he is still sleeping.”

##
“Anyway, now I can run to the river for a nice
breakfast,” she thought. Nosisa ran to the river.
When she got there she called out to the fish, and
she called again and again. The fish never came.
Nosisa started to cry. She did not know what had
happened to the fish.
While she was crying a bird came to sit next to her
and told her what had happened. She cried harder
thinking that her mother had been caught and eaten.

##
The bird told her to collect the fish bones from the
table and throw them back into the river. If she did
that the fish would come back to life. The bird also
told her to let her father and stepmother sleep and
wake them up only at midday. Nosisa did as she was
told. She ran back home and walked quietly into her
father's hut. They were still fast asleep. She took the
bones, put them inside a bag and threw them back
into the river.

##
Nosisa ran back home and just before midday she
woke her father and stepmother. She could hardly
recognise them. They looked old and grey and frail.
They were too old to scold her. They were too weak
to hit her. They were too tired to look after the
homestead.
So, Nosisa took over the homestead and her father's
wealth. She called all the servants and told them
what had happened. They prepared a feast and there
was peace at the homestead from that day on.
