# Holidays with grandmother

##
Odongo and Apiyo lived in the
city with their father.
They looked forward to the
holidays. Not just because
school was closed, but because
they went to visit their
grandmother.
She lived in a fishing village
near a large lake.

##
Odongo and Apiyo were excited
because it was time to visit
their grandmother again.
The night before, they packed
their bags and got ready for the
long journey to her village.
They could not sleep and talked
the whole night about the
holiday.

##
Early the next morning, they
left for the village in their
father's car.
They drove past mountains,
wild animals and tea
plantations.
They counted cars and sang
songs.

##
After a while, the children were
tired and fell asleep.

##
Father woke up Odongo and
Apiyo as they arrived in the
village.
They found Nyar-Kanyada, their
grandmother, resting on a mat
under a tree.
Nyar-Kanyada in Luo, means
‘daughter of the people of
Kanyada'.
She was a strong and beautiful
woman.

##
Nyar-Kanyada welcomed them
into the house and danced
around the room singing with
joy.
Her grandchildren were excited
to give her the presents they
brought from the city.
“First open my gift,” said
Odongo.
“No, my gift first!” said Apiyo.

##
After she opened the presents,
Nyar-Kanyada blessed her
grandchildren in a traditional
way.

##
Then Odongo and Apiyo went
outside. They chased butterflies
and birds.

##
They climbed trees and
splashed in the water of the
lake.

##
When it was dark they returned
to the house for dinner.
Before they could finish eating,
they were falling asleep!

##
The next day, the children's
father drove back to the city
leaving them with Nyar-Kanyada.

##
Odongo and Apiyo helped their
grandmother with household
chores.
They fetched water and
firewood.
They collected eggs from the
chickens and picked greens
from the garden.

##
Nyar-Kanyada taught her
grandchildren to make soft ugali
to eat with stew.
She showed them how to make
coconut rice to eat with roast
fish.

##
One morning, Odongo took his
grandmother's cows to graze.
They ran onto a neighbour's
farm.
The farmer was angry with
Odongo. He threatened to keep
the cows for eating his crops.
After that day, the boy made
sure that the cows did not get
into trouble again.

##
On another day, the children
went to the marketplace with
Nyar-Kanyada.
She had a stall selling
vegetables, sugar and soap.
Apiyo liked to tell customers the
price of items.
Odongo would pack the items
that customers bought.

##
At the end of the day they
drank chai tea together.
They helped grandmother to
count the money she earned.

##
But too soon the holidays were
over and the children had to go
back to the city.
Nyar-Kanyada gave Odongo a
cap and Apiyo a sweater.
She packed food for their
journey.

##
When their father came to fetch
them, they did not want to
leave.
The children begged Nyar-Kanyada to go with them to the
city.
She smiled and said, “I am too
old for the city. I will be waiting
for you to come to my village
again.”

##
Odongo and Apiyo both hugged
her tightly and said goodbye.

##
When Odongo and Apiyo went
back to school they told their
friends about life in the village.
Some children felt that life in
the city was good.
Others felt that the village was
better.
But most of all, everyone
agreed that Odongo and Apiyo
had a wonderful grandmother!
